alias pride0 "say It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune,"
alias pride1 "say must be in want of a wife."
alias pride2 "say However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a"
alias pride3 "say neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is"
alias pride4 "say considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters."
alias pride5 "say "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield"
alias pride6 "say Park is let at last?""
alias pride7 "say Mr. Bennet replied that he had not."
alias pride8 "say "But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.""
alias pride9 "say Mr. Bennet made no answer. "
alias pride10 "say "Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently."
alias pride11 "say "You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.""
alias pride12 "say This was invitation enough."
alias pride13 "say "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young"
alias pride14 "say man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise"
alias pride15 "say and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris"
alias pride16 "say immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are"
alias pride17 "say to be in the house by the end of next week.""
alias pride18 "say "What is his name?""
alias pride19 "say "Bingley.""
alias pride20 "say "Is he married or single?""
alias pride21 "say "Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a"
alias pride22 "say year. What a fine thing for our girls!""
alias pride23 "say "How so? How can it affect them?""
alias pride24 "say "My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know"
alias pride25 "say that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.""
alias pride26 "say "Is that his design in settling here?""
alias pride27 "say "Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love"
alias pride28 "say with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.""
alias pride29 "say "I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by"
alias pride30 "say themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them,"
alias pride31 "say Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.""
alias pride32 "say "My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to"
alias pride33 "say be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to"
alias pride34 "say give over thinking of her own beauty.""
alias pride35 "say "In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.""
alias pride36 "say "But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the"
alias pride37 "say neighbourhood.""
alias pride38 "say "It is more than I engage for, I assure you.""
alias pride39 "say "But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of"
alias pride40 "say them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in"
alias pride41 "say general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible"
alias pride42 "say for us to visit him if you do not." "
alias pride43 "say "You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you;"
alias pride44 "say and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying"
alias pride45 "say whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.""
alias pride46 "say "I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure"
alias pride47 "say she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are"
alias pride48 "say always giving her the preference.""
alias pride49 "say "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and"
alias pride50 "say ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.""
alias pride51 "say "Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in"
alias pride52 "say vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.""
alias pride53 "say "You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old"
alias pride54 "say friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.""
alias pride55 "say "Ah, you do not know what I suffer.""
alias pride56 "say "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year"
alias pride57 "say come into the neighbourhood.""
alias pride58 "say "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.""
alias pride59 "say "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.""
alias pride60 "say Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice,"
alias pride61 "say that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife"
alias pride62 "say understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean"
alias pride63 "say understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she"
alias pride64 "say fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace"
alias pride65 "say was visiting and news."
alias pride66 "say Chapter 2"
alias pride67 "say Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always"
alias pride68 "say intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and"
alias pride69 "say till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in"
alias pride70 "say the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he"
alias pride71 "say suddenly addressed her with:"
alias pride72 "say "I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.""
alias pride73 "say "We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully,"
alias pride74 "say "since we are not to visit." "
alias pride75 "say "But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and"
alias pride76 "say that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.""
alias pride77 "say "I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is"
alias pride78 "say a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.""
alias pride79 "say "No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her"
alias pride80 "say serving you.""
alias pride81 "say Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began"
alias pride82 "say scolding one of her daughters."
alias pride83 "say "Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my"
alias pride84 "say nerves. You tear them to pieces.""
alias pride85 "say "Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill.""
alias pride86 "say "I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully. "When is your next ball"
alias pride87 "say to be, Lizzy?""
alias pride88 "say "To-morrow fortnight.""
alias pride89 "say "Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before;"
alias pride90 "say so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.""
alias pride91 "say "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley"
alias pride92 "say to her.""
alias pride93 "say "Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how"
alias pride94 "say can you be so teasing?""
alias pride95 "say "I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One"
alias pride96 "say cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture"
alias pride97 "say somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance;"
alias pride98 "say and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it"
alias pride99 "say on myself.""
alias pride100 "say The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!""
alias pride101 "say "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do you consider the"
alias pride102 "say forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree"
alias pride103 "say with you there. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know,"
alias pride104 "say and read great books and make extracts.""
alias pride105 "say Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how."
alias pride106 "say "While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr. Bingley.""
alias pride107 "say "I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife. "
alias pride108 "say "I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much"
alias pride109 "say this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have"
alias pride110 "say actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.""
alias pride111 "say The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps"
alias pride112 "say surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that"
alias pride113 "say it was what she had expected all the while."
alias pride114 "say "How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last."
alias pride115 "say I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased"
alias pride116 "say I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said"
alias pride117 "say a word about it till now.""
alias pride118 "say "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke,"
alias pride119 "say he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife."
alias pride120 "say "What an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when the door was shut. "I do not"
alias pride121 "say know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter."
alias pride122 "say At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every"
alias pride123 "say day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you are the"
alias pride124 "say youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.""
alias pride125 "say "Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest.""
alias pride126 "say The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's"
alias pride127 "say visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner."
alias pride128 "say Chapter 3"
alias pride129 "say Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on"
alias pride130 "say the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr."
alias pride131 "say Bingley. They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious"
alias pride132 "say suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last"
alias pride133 "say obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report"
alias pride134 "say was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young,"
alias pride135 "say wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the"
alias pride136 "say next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing"
alias pride137 "say was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were"
alias pride138 "say entertained."
alias pride139 "say "If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to"
alias pride140 "say her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.""
alias pride141 "say In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him"
alias pride142 "say in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of "
alias pride143 "say whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat"
alias pride144 "say more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he"
alias pride145 "say wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse."
alias pride146 "say An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet"
alias pride147 "say planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived"
alias pride148 "say which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and,"
alias pride149 "say consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite"
alias pride150 "say disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his"
alias pride151 "say arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from"
alias pride152 "say one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted"
alias pride153 "say her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for"
alias pride154 "say the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven"
alias pride155 "say gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but"
alias pride156 "say were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only"
alias pride157 "say six with him from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the"
alias pride158 "say assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the"
alias pride159 "say husband of the eldest, and another young man."
alias pride160 "say Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and"
alias pride161 "say easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His"
alias pride162 "say brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon"
alias pride163 "say drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and"
alias pride164 "say the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his"
alias pride165 "say having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the"
alias pride166 "say ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great"
alias pride167 "say admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide"
alias pride168 "say of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above"
alias pride169 "say being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a"
alias pride170 "say most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his"
alias pride171 "say friend."
alias pride172 "say Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room;"
alias pride173 "say he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,"
alias pride174 "say and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for"
alias pride175 "say themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with"
alias pride176 "say Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and"
alias pride177 "say spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his"
alias pride178 "say own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the"
alias pride179 "say world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most"
alias pride180 "say violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened"
alias pride181 "say into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters."
alias pride182 "say Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two"
alias pride183 "say dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to"
alias pride184 "say hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few"
alias pride185 "say minutes, to press his friend to join it. "
alias pride186 "say "Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by"
alias pride187 "say yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.""
alias pride188 "say "I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with"
alias pride189 "say my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged,"
alias pride190 "say and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to"
alias pride191 "say stand up with.""
alias pride192 "say "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Mr. Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my"
alias pride193 "say honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there"
alias pride194 "say are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.""
alias pride195 "say "You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at"
alias pride196 "say the eldest Miss Bennet."
alias pride197 "say "Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters"
alias pride198 "say sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me"
alias pride199 "say ask my partner to introduce you.""
alias pride200 "say "Which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till"
alias pride201 "say catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: "She is tolerable, but not handsome"
alias pride202 "say enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who"
alias pride203 "say are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for"
alias pride204 "say you are wasting your time with me.""
alias pride205 "say Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no"
alias pride206 "say very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her"
alias pride207 "say friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous."
alias pride208 "say The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen"
alias pride209 "say her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with"
alias pride210 "say her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this"
alias pride211 "say as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had"
alias pride212 "say heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the"
alias pride213 "say neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without"
alias pride214 "say partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore,"
alias pride215 "say in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the"
alias pride216 "say principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of"
alias pride217 "say time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an"
alias pride218 "say evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's"
alias pride219 "say views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different"
alias pride220 "say story to hear."
alias pride221 "say "Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful"
alias pride222 "say evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing"
alias pride223 "say could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite"
alias pride224 "say beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with"
alias pride225 "say her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of"
alias pride226 "say all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did "
alias pride227 "say not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane"
alias pride228 "say as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and"
alias pride229 "say asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth"
alias pride230 "say with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the"
alias pride231 "say Boulanger—""
alias pride232 "say "If he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not"
alias pride233 "say have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had"
alias pride234 "say sprained his ankle in the first dance!""
alias pride235 "say "Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! And his"
alias pride236 "say sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their"
alias pride237 "say dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown—""
alias pride238 "say Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery."
alias pride239 "say She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much"
alias pride240 "say bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy."
alias pride241 "say "But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his"
alias pride242 "say fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so"
alias pride243 "say conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying"
alias pride244 "say himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my"
alias pride245 "say dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.""
alias pride246 "say Chapter 4"
alias pride247 "say When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of"
alias pride248 "say Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him."
alias pride249 "say "He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good-humoured, lively;"
alias pride250 "say and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!""
alias pride251 "say "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he"
alias pride252 "say possibly can. His character is thereby complete.""
alias pride253 "say "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such"
alias pride254 "say a compliment.""
alias pride255 "say "Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments"
alias pride256 "say always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you"
alias pride257 "say again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other"
alias pride258 "say woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable,"
alias pride259 "say and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.""
alias pride260 "say "Dear Lizzy!" "
alias pride261 "say "Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a"
alias pride262 "say fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you"
alias pride263 "say speak ill of a human being in your life.""
alias pride264 "say "I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think.""
alias pride265 "say "I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so"
alias pride266 "say honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common"
alias pride267 "say enough—one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design—to"
alias pride268 "say take the good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—"
alias pride269 "say belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not"
alias pride270 "say equal to his.""
alias pride271 "say "Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them."
alias pride272 "say Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we"
alias pride273 "say shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.""
alias pride274 "say Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had"
alias pride275 "say not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less"
alias pride276 "say pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to"
alias pride277 "say herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not"
alias pride278 "say deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves"
alias pride279 "say agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had"
alias pride280 "say been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty"
alias pride281 "say thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating"
alias pride282 "say with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves,"
alias pride283 "say and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a"
alias pride284 "say circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and"
alias pride285 "say their own had been acquired by trade."
alias pride286 "say Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from"
alias pride287 "say his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley"
alias pride288 "say intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided"
alias pride289 "say with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best"
alias pride290 "say knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at"
alias pride291 "say Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase."
alias pride292 "say His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only"
alias pride293 "say established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table—"
alias pride294 "say nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to"
alias pride295 "say consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two"
alias pride296 "say years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House."
alias pride297 "say He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was pleased with the situation and the"
alias pride298 "say principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately."
alias pride299 "say Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of"
alias pride300 "say character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his"
alias pride301 "say temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his"
alias pride302 "say own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley had the "
alias pride303 "say firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the"
alias pride304 "say superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same"
alias pride305 "say time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not"
alias pride306 "say inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being"
alias pride307 "say liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense."
alias pride308 "say The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic."
alias pride309 "say Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had"
alias pride310 "say been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon"
alias pride311 "say felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel"
alias pride312 "say more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was"
alias pride313 "say little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from"
alias pride314 "say none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but"
alias pride315 "say she smiled too much."
alias pride316 "say Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they admired her and liked her, and"
alias pride317 "say pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of."
alias pride318 "say Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by"
alias pride319 "say such commendation to think of her as he chose."
alias pride320 "say Chapter 5"
alias pride321 "say Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were"
alias pride322 "say particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he"
alias pride323 "say had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the"
alias pride324 "say king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given"
alias pride325 "say him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting"
alias pride326 "say them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton,"
alias pride327 "say denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own"
alias pride328 "say importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the"
alias pride329 "say world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he"
alias pride330 "say was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his"
alias pride331 "say presentation at St. James's had made him courteous."
alias pride332 "say Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to"
alias pride333 "say Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young"
alias pride334 "say woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend."
alias pride335 "say That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was"
alias pride336 "say absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn"
alias pride337 "say to hear and to communicate."
alias pride338 "say "You began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to"
alias pride339 "say Miss Lucas. "You were Mr. Bingley's first choice." "
alias pride340 "say "Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.""
alias pride341 "say "Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did"
alias pride342 "say seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he did—I heard something about it—but"
alias pride343 "say I hardly know what—something about Mr. Robinson.""
alias pride344 "say "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it"
alias pride345 "say to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he"
alias pride346 "say did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the"
alias pride347 "say prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,"
alias pride348 "say beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'""
alias pride349 "say "Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem as if—but, however,"
alias pride350 "say it may all come to nothing, you know.""
alias pride351 "say "My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza," said Charlotte. "Mr."
alias pride352 "say Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?—poor Eliza!—to be only just"
alias pride353 "say tolerable.""
alias pride354 "say "I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is"
alias pride355 "say such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long"
alias pride356 "say told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.""
alias pride357 "say "Are you quite sure, ma'am?—is not there a little mistake?" said Jane. "I certainly saw"
alias pride358 "say Mr. Darcy speaking to her.""
alias pride359 "say "Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help"
alias pride360 "say answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to.""
alias pride361 "say "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much, unless among his"
alias pride362 "say intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably agreeable.""
alias pride363 "say "I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have"
alias pride364 "say talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with"
alias pride365 "say pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and"
alias pride366 "say had come to the ball in a hack chaise.""
alias pride367 "say "I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced"
alias pride368 "say with Eliza.""
alias pride369 "say "Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with him, if I were you.""
alias pride370 "say "I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him.""
alias pride371 "say "His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend me so much as pride often does, because"
alias pride372 "say there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family,"
alias pride373 "say fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he"
alias pride374 "say has a right to be proud.""
alias pride375 "say "That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not"
alias pride376 "say mortified mine." "
alias pride377 "say "Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very"
alias pride378 "say common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very"
alias pride379 "say common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of"
alias pride380 "say us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other,"
alias pride381 "say real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used"
alias pride382 "say synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our"
alias pride383 "say opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.""
alias pride384 "say "If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came with his sisters, "I"
alias pride385 "say should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of"
alias pride386 "say wine a day.""
alias pride387 "say "Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs. Bennet; "and if I"
alias pride388 "say were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.""
alias pride389 "say The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the"
alias pride390 "say argument ended only with the visit."
alias pride391 "say Chapter 6"
alias pride392 "say The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was soon"
alias pride393 "say returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst"
alias pride394 "say and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger"
alias pride395 "say sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed"
alias pride396 "say towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but"
alias pride397 "say Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even"
alias pride398 "say her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value"
alias pride399 "say as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was generally"
alias pride400 "say evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that"
alias pride401 "say Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first,"
alias pride402 "say and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not"
alias pride403 "say likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of"
alias pride404 "say feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard"
alias pride405 "say her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas."
alias pride406 "say "It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in"
alias pride407 "say such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals"
alias pride408 "say her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing"
alias pride409 "say him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There"
alias pride410 "say is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any"
alias pride411 "say to itself. We can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very"
alias pride412 "say few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases"
alias pride413 "say out of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister"
alias pride414 "say undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on." "
alias pride415 "say "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard"
alias pride416 "say for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.""
alias pride417 "say "Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.""
alias pride418 "say "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it"
alias pride419 "say out.""
alias pride420 "say "Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably"
alias pride421 "say often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed"
alias pride422 "say parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane"
alias pride423 "say should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention."
alias pride424 "say When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she"
alias pride425 "say chooses.""
alias pride426 "say "Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire"
alias pride427 "say of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare"
alias pride428 "say say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,"
alias pride429 "say she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She"
alias pride430 "say has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him"
alias pride431 "say one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is"
alias pride432 "say not quite enough to make her understand his character.""
alias pride433 "say "Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered"
alias pride434 "say whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been"
alias pride435 "say spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal.""
alias pride436 "say "Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un"
alias pride437 "say better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine"
alias pride438 "say that much has been unfolded.""
alias pride439 "say "Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to"
alias pride440 "say him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be"
alias pride441 "say studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of"
alias pride442 "say chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so"
alias pride443 "say similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to"
alias pride444 "say grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know"
alias pride445 "say as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.""
alias pride446 "say "You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that"
alias pride447 "say you would never act in this way yourself.""
alias pride448 "say Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from"
alias pride449 "say suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend."
alias pride450 "say Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without"
alias pride451 "say admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no"
alias pride452 "say sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in"
alias pride453 "say her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful"
alias pride454 "say expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying."
alias pride455 "say Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her "
alias pride456 "say form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his"
alias pride457 "say asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their"
alias pride458 "say easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made"
alias pride459 "say himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with."
alias pride460 "say He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her"
alias pride461 "say himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir"
alias pride462 "say William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled."
alias pride463 "say "What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation"
alias pride464 "say with Colonel Forster?""
alias pride465 "say "That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.""
alias pride466 "say "But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He"
alias pride467 "say has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow"
alias pride468 "say afraid of him.""
alias pride469 "say On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention"
alias pride470 "say of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which"
alias pride471 "say immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:"
alias pride472 "say "Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when"
alias pride473 "say I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?""
alias pride474 "say "With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic.""
alias pride475 "say "You are severe on us.""
alias pride476 "say "It will be her turn soon to be teased," said Miss Lucas. "I am going to open the"
alias pride477 "say instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.""
alias pride478 "say "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and"
alias pride479 "say sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have"
alias pride480 "say been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in"
alias pride481 "say the habit of hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she"
alias pride482 "say added, "Very well, if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, "There is a"
alias pride483 "say fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool"
alias pride484 "say your porridge'; and I shall keep mine to swell my song.""
alias pride485 "say Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and"
alias pride486 "say before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly"
alias pride487 "say succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the"
alias pride488 "say only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always"
alias pride489 "say impatient for display."
alias pride490 "say Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had"
alias pride491 "say given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher"
alias pride492 "say degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been"
alias pride493 "say listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end"
alias pride494 "say of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the "
alias pride495 "say request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers,"
alias pride496 "say joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room."
alias pride497 "say Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to"
alias pride498 "say the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive"
alias pride499 "say that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:"
alias pride500 "say "What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like"
alias pride501 "say dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society.""
alias pride502 "say "Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished"
alias pride503 "say societies of the world. Every savage can dance.""
alias pride504 "say Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully," he continued after a pause,"
alias pride505 "say on seeing Bingley join the group; "and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science"
alias pride506 "say yourself, Mr. Darcy.""
alias pride507 "say "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.""
alias pride508 "say "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance"
alias pride509 "say at St. James's?""
alias pride510 "say "Never, sir.""
alias pride511 "say "Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?""
alias pride512 "say "It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.""
alias pride513 "say "You have a house in town, I conclude?""
alias pride514 "say Mr. Darcy bowed."
alias pride515 "say "I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself—for I am fond of superior"
alias pride516 "say society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady"
alias pride517 "say Lucas.""
alias pride518 "say He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and"
alias pride519 "say Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very"
alias pride520 "say gallant thing, and called out to her:"
alias pride521 "say "My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present"
alias pride522 "say this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure"
alias pride523 "say when so much beauty is before you." And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr."
alias pride524 "say Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly"
alias pride525 "say drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:"
alias pride526 "say "Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to suppose that I"
alias pride527 "say moved this way in order to beg for a partner.""
alias pride528 "say Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in"
alias pride529 "say vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt"
alias pride530 "say at persuasion. "
alias pride531 "say "You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of"
alias pride532 "say seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no"
alias pride533 "say objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.""
alias pride534 "say "Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling."
alias pride535 "say "He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder"
alias pride536 "say at his complaisance—for who would object to such a partner?""
alias pride537 "say Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the"
alias pride538 "say gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss"
alias pride539 "say Bingley:"
alias pride540 "say "I can guess the subject of your reverie.""
alias pride541 "say "I should imagine not.""
alias pride542 "say "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this"
alias pride543 "say manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more"
alias pride544 "say annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise—the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of"
alias pride545 "say all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!""
alias pride546 "say "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I"
alias pride547 "say have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a"
alias pride548 "say pretty woman can bestow.""
alias pride549 "say Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what"
alias pride550 "say lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:"
alias pride551 "say "Miss Elizabeth Bennet.""
alias pride552 "say "Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all astonishment. How long has"
alias pride553 "say she been such a favourite?—and pray, when am I to wish you joy?""
alias pride554 "say "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's imagination is very"
alias pride555 "say rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you"
alias pride556 "say would be wishing me joy.""
alias pride557 "say "Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. You will"
alias pride558 "say be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at"
alias pride559 "say Pemberley with you.""
alias pride560 "say He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this"
alias pride561 "say manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long."
alias pride562 "say Chapter 7 "
alias pride563 "say Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year,"
alias pride564 "say which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant"
alias pride565 "say relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill"
alias pride566 "say supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her"
alias pride567 "say four thousand pounds."
alias pride568 "say She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and"
alias pride569 "say succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade."
alias pride570 "say The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance"
alias pride571 "say for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay"
alias pride572 "say their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the"
alias pride573 "say family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were"
alias pride574 "say more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was"
alias pride575 "say necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and"
alias pride576 "say however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some"
alias pride577 "say from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness"
alias pride578 "say by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole"
alias pride579 "say winter, and Meryton was the headquarters."
alias pride580 "say Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence."
alias pride581 "say Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections."
alias pride582 "say Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers"
alias pride583 "say themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity"
alias pride584 "say unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune,"
alias pride585 "say the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when"
alias pride586 "say opposed to the regimentals of an ensign."
alias pride587 "say After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly"
alias pride588 "say observed:"
alias pride589 "say "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest"
alias pride590 "say girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.""
alias pride591 "say Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference,"
alias pride592 "say continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the"
alias pride593 "say course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London."
alias pride594 "say "I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your"
alias pride595 "say own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of"
alias pride596 "say my own, however.""
alias pride597 "say "If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.""
alias pride598 "say "Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.""
alias pride599 "say "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our"
alias pride600 "say sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our"
alias pride601 "say two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish." "
alias pride602 "say "My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and"
alias pride603 "say mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more"
alias pride604 "say than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and, indeed, so I"
alias pride605 "say do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should"
alias pride606 "say want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very"
alias pride607 "say becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals.""
alias pride608 "say "Mamma," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go"
alias pride609 "say so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often"
alias pride610 "say standing in Clarke's library.""
alias pride611 "say Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss"
alias pride612 "say Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes"
alias pride613 "say sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,"
alias pride614 "say "Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, Jane, make haste"
alias pride615 "say and tell us; make haste, my love.""
alias pride616 "say "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud."
alias pride617 "say "MY DEAR FRIEND,—"
alias pride618 "say "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in"
alias pride619 "say danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between"
alias pride620 "say two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this."
alias pride621 "say My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.—Yours ever,"
alias pride622 "say "CAROLINE BINGLEY""
alias pride623 "say "With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.""
alias pride624 "say "Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky.""
alias pride625 "say "Can I have the carriage?" said Jane."
alias pride626 "say "No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then"
alias pride627 "say you must stay all night.""
alias pride628 "say "That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not"
alias pride629 "say offer to send her home.""
alias pride630 "say "Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts"
alias pride631 "say have no horses to theirs.""
alias pride632 "say "I had much rather go in the coach.""
alias pride633 "say "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the"
alias pride634 "say farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?""
alias pride635 "say "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them." "
alias pride636 "say "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be"
alias pride637 "say answered.""
alias pride638 "say She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged."
alias pride639 "say Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with"
alias pride640 "say many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone"
alias pride641 "say long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted."
alias pride642 "say The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come"
alias pride643 "say back."
alias pride644 "say "This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet more than once, as if the"
alias pride645 "say credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware"
alias pride646 "say of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from"
alias pride647 "say Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:"
alias pride648 "say "MY DEAREST LIZZY,—"
alias pride649 "say "I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting"
alias pride650 "say wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They"
alias pride651 "say insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his"
alias pride652 "say having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter"
alias pride653 "say with me.—Yours, etc.""
alias pride654 "say "Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your"
alias pride655 "say daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness—if she should die, it would be a comfort to"
alias pride656 "say know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.""
alias pride657 "say "Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be"
alias pride658 "say taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I"
alias pride659 "say could have the carriage.""
alias pride660 "say Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was"
alias pride661 "say not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She"
alias pride662 "say declared her resolution."
alias pride663 "say "How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!"
alias pride664 "say You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.""
alias pride665 "say "I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.""
alias pride666 "say "Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?""
alias pride667 "say "No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a"
alias pride668 "say motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.""
alias pride669 "say "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of"
alias pride670 "say feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in"
alias pride671 "say proportion to what is required.""
alias pride672 "say "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia. Elizabeth accepted"
alias pride673 "say their company, and the three young ladies set off together. "
alias pride674 "say "If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of"
alias pride675 "say Captain Carter before he goes.""
alias pride676 "say In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers'"
alias pride677 "say wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace,"
alias pride678 "say jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself"
alias pride679 "say at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with"
alias pride680 "say the warmth of exercise."
alias pride681 "say She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where"
alias pride682 "say her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so"
alias pride683 "say early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst"
alias pride684 "say and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She"
alias pride685 "say was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was"
alias pride686 "say something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very"
alias pride687 "say little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the"
alias pride688 "say brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's"
alias pride689 "say justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast."
alias pride690 "say Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept"
alias pride691 "say ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was"
alias pride692 "say glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of"
alias pride693 "say giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a"
alias pride694 "say visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and"
alias pride695 "say when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude"
alias pride696 "say for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her."
alias pride697 "say When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like"
alias pride698 "say them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The"
alias pride699 "say apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had"
alias pride700 "say caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to"
alias pride701 "say return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the"
alias pride702 "say feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room"
alias pride703 "say for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in"
alias pride704 "say fact, nothing to do elsewhere."
alias pride705 "say When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so."
alias pride706 "say Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it,"
alias pride707 "say when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to"
alias pride708 "say convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present."
alias pride709 "say Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to"
alias pride710 "say acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes."
alias pride711 "say Chapter 8 "
alias pride712 "say At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was"
alias pride713 "say summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she"
alias pride714 "say had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could"
alias pride715 "say not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing"
alias pride716 "say this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have"
alias pride717 "say a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no"
alias pride718 "say more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them"
alias pride719 "say restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike."
alias pride720 "say Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any"
alias pride721 "say complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing,"
alias pride722 "say and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was"
alias pride723 "say considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was"
alias pride724 "say engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom"
alias pride725 "say Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who,"
alias pride726 "say when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her."
alias pride727 "say When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her"
alias pride728 "say as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a"
alias pride729 "say mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst"
alias pride730 "say thought the same, and added:"
alias pride731 "say "She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never"
alias pride732 "say forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild.""
alias pride733 "say "She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come"
alias pride734 "say at all! Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her"
alias pride735 "say hair, so untidy, so blowsy!""
alias pride736 "say "Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am"
alias pride737 "say absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.""
alias pride738 "say "Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me. I"
alias pride739 "say thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this"
alias pride740 "say morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.""
alias pride741 "say "You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think"
alias pride742 "say that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition.""
alias pride743 "say "Certainly not.""
alias pride744 "say "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in"
alias pride745 "say dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an"
alias pride746 "say abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.""
alias pride747 "say "It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley."
alias pride748 "say "I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, "that this adventure"
alias pride749 "say has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes." "
alias pride750 "say "Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise." A short pause followed"
alias pride751 "say this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:"
alias pride752 "say "I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I"
alias pride753 "say wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such"
alias pride754 "say low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.""
alias pride755 "say "I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.""
alias pride756 "say "Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.""
alias pride757 "say "That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily."
alias pride758 "say "If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them"
alias pride759 "say one jot less agreeable.""
alias pride760 "say "But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in"
alias pride761 "say the world," replied Darcy."
alias pride762 "say To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and"
alias pride763 "say indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations."
alias pride764 "say With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the diningparlour,"
alias pride765 "say and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth"
alias pride766 "say would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her"
alias pride767 "say sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs"
alias pride768 "say herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was"
alias pride769 "say immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it,"
alias pride770 "say and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could"
alias pride771 "say stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment."
alias pride772 "say "Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular.""
alias pride773 "say "Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She is a great reader, and has no"
alias pride774 "say pleasure in anything else.""
alias pride775 "say "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am not a great reader,"
alias pride776 "say and I have pleasure in many things.""
alias pride777 "say "In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will be"
alias pride778 "say soon increased by seeing her quite well.""
alias pride779 "say Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few"
alias pride780 "say books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others—all that his library afforded."
alias pride781 "say "And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an"
alias pride782 "say idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into.""
alias pride783 "say Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room."
alias pride784 "say "I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a"
alias pride785 "say collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!" "
alias pride786 "say "It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations.""
alias pride787 "say "And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.""
alias pride788 "say "I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.""
alias pride789 "say "Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place."
alias pride790 "say Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.""
alias pride791 "say "I wish it may.""
alias pride792 "say "But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take"
alias pride793 "say Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.""
alias pride794 "say "With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.""
alias pride795 "say "I am talking of possibilities, Charles.""
alias pride796 "say "Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase"
alias pride797 "say than by imitation.""
alias pride798 "say Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for"
alias pride799 "say her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed"
alias pride800 "say herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game."
alias pride801 "say "Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will she be as tall as I"
alias pride802 "say am?""
alias pride803 "say "I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller.""
alias pride804 "say "How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such"
alias pride805 "say a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her"
alias pride806 "say performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.""
alias pride807 "say "It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very"
alias pride808 "say accomplished as they all are.""
alias pride809 "say "All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?""
alias pride810 "say "Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely"
alias pride811 "say know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for"
alias pride812 "say the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.""
alias pride813 "say "Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth."
alias pride814 "say The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse"
alias pride815 "say or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies"
alias pride816 "say in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my"
alias pride817 "say acquaintance, that are really accomplished.""
alias pride818 "say "Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley."
alias pride819 "say "Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an"
alias pride820 "say accomplished woman." "
alias pride821 "say "Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.""
alias pride822 "say "Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished"
alias pride823 "say who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough"
alias pride824 "say knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the"
alias pride825 "say word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of"
alias pride826 "say walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but halfdeserved.""
alias pride827 "say "All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something"
alias pride828 "say more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.""
alias pride829 "say "I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather"
alias pride830 "say wonder now at your knowing any.""
alias pride831 "say "Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?""
alias pride832 "say "I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and"
alias pride833 "say elegance, as you describe united.""
alias pride834 "say Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt,"
alias pride835 "say and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when"
alias pride836 "say Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going"
alias pride837 "say forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room."
alias pride838 "say "Elizabeth Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those"
alias pride839 "say young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their"
alias pride840 "say own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a"
alias pride841 "say very mean art.""
alias pride842 "say "Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is a"
alias pride843 "say meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation."
alias pride844 "say Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.""
alias pride845 "say Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject."
alias pride846 "say Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not"
alias pride847 "say leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced"
alias pride848 "say that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of"
alias pride849 "say the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to"
alias pride850 "say comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for"
alias pride851 "say early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite"
alias pride852 "say uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their"
alias pride853 "say wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his"
alias pride854 "say feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the"
alias pride855 "say sick lady and her sister. "
alias pride856 "say Chapter 9"
alias pride857 "say Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the"
alias pride858 "say pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early"
alias pride859 "say received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant"
alias pride860 "say ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have"
alias pride861 "say a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of"
alias pride862 "say her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied"
alias pride863 "say with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after"
alias pride864 "say the family breakfast."
alias pride865 "say Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very"
alias pride866 "say miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no"
alias pride867 "say wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her"
alias pride868 "say from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried"
alias pride869 "say home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable."
alias pride870 "say After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the"
alias pride871 "say mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them"
alias pride872 "say with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected."
alias pride873 "say "Indeed I have, sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones"
alias pride874 "say says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.""
alias pride875 "say "Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear"
alias pride876 "say of her removal.""
alias pride877 "say "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss"
alias pride878 "say Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.""
alias pride879 "say Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments."
alias pride880 "say "I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would"
alias pride881 "say become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest"
alias pride882 "say patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the"
alias pride883 "say sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her."
alias pride884 "say You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I"
alias pride885 "say do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of"
alias pride886 "say quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.""
alias pride887 "say "Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit"
alias pride888 "say Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider"
alias pride889 "say myself as quite fixed here.""
alias pride890 "say "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth."
alias pride891 "say "You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her."
alias pride892 "say "Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly." "
alias pride893 "say "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is"
alias pride894 "say pitiful.""
alias pride895 "say "That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less"
alias pride896 "say estimable than such a one as yours.""
alias pride897 "say "Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild"
alias pride898 "say manner that you are suffered to do at home.""
alias pride899 "say "I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of"
alias pride900 "say character. It must be an amusing study.""
alias pride901 "say "Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage.""
alias pride902 "say "The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In"
alias pride903 "say a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.""
alias pride904 "say "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them"
alias pride905 "say for ever.""
alias pride906 "say "Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country"
alias pride907 "say neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in"
alias pride908 "say town.""
alias pride909 "say Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently"
alias pride910 "say away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her"
alias pride911 "say triumph."
alias pride912 "say "I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except"
alias pride913 "say the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?""
alias pride914 "say "When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town"
alias pride915 "say it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in"
alias pride916 "say either.""
alias pride917 "say "Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman," looking at"
alias pride918 "say Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all.""
alias pride919 "say "Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. "You quite"
alias pride920 "say mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met"
alias pride921 "say with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true.""
alias pride922 "say "Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in"
alias pride923 "say this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with"
alias pride924 "say four-and-twenty families.""
alias pride925 "say Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His"
alias pride926 "say sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive"
alias pride927 "say smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts,"
alias pride928 "say now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away. "
alias pride929 "say "Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr."
alias pride930 "say Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He has always"
alias pride931 "say something to say to everybody. That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who"
alias pride932 "say fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.""
alias pride933 "say "Did Charlotte dine with you?""
alias pride934 "say "No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr."
alias pride935 "say Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up"
alias pride936 "say very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good"
alias pride937 "say sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so"
alias pride938 "say very plain—but then she is our particular friend.""
alias pride939 "say "She seems a very pleasant young woman.""
alias pride940 "say "Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so,"
alias pride941 "say and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—"
alias pride942 "say one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my"
alias pride943 "say own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in"
alias pride944 "say town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer"
alias pride945 "say before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young."
alias pride946 "say However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.""
alias pride947 "say "And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There has been many a one, I"
alias pride948 "say fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in"
alias pride949 "say driving away love!""
alias pride950 "say "I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love," said Darcy."
alias pride951 "say "Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if"
alias pride952 "say it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it"
alias pride953 "say entirely away.""
alias pride954 "say Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her"
alias pride955 "say mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to"
alias pride956 "say say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his"
alias pride957 "say kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was"
alias pride958 "say unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what"
alias pride959 "say the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs."
alias pride960 "say Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the"
alias pride961 "say youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each"
alias pride962 "say other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr."
alias pride963 "say Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at"
alias pride964 "say Netherfield."
alias pride965 "say Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured"
alias pride966 "say countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an"
alias pride967 "say early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the"
alias pride968 "say attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners"
alias pride969 "say recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address "
alias pride970 "say Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding,"
alias pride971 "say that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to"
alias pride972 "say this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:"
alias pride973 "say "I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is"
alias pride974 "say recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish"
alias pride975 "say to be dancing when she is ill.""
alias pride976 "say Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes—it would be much better to wait till Jane was"
alias pride977 "say well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you"
alias pride978 "say have given your ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel"
alias pride979 "say Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.""
alias pride980 "say Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane,"
alias pride981 "say leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr."
alias pride982 "say Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of"
alias pride983 "say her, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes."
alias pride984 "say Chapter 10"
alias pride985 "say The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent"
alias pride986 "say some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in"
alias pride987 "say the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did"
alias pride988 "say not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the"
alias pride989 "say progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr."
alias pride990 "say Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game."
alias pride991 "say Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what"
alias pride992 "say passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either"
alias pride993 "say on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the"
alias pride994 "say perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and"
alias pride995 "say was exactly in union with her opinion of each."
alias pride996 "say "How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!""
alias pride997 "say He made no answer."
alias pride998 "say "You write uncommonly fast.""
alias pride999 "say "You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.""
alias pride1000 "say "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of"
alias pride1001 "say business, too! How odious I should think them!""
alias pride1002 "say "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours." "
alias pride1003 "say "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.""
alias pride1004 "say "I have already told her so once, by your desire.""
alias pride1005 "say "I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably"
alias pride1006 "say well.""
alias pride1007 "say "Thank you—but I always mend my own.""
alias pride1008 "say "How can you contrive to write so even?""
alias pride1009 "say He was silent."
alias pride1010 "say "Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her"
alias pride1011 "say know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it"
alias pride1012 "say infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's.""
alias pride1013 "say "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not"
alias pride1014 "say room to do them justice.""
alias pride1015 "say "Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such"
alias pride1016 "say charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?""
alias pride1017 "say "They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.""
alias pride1018 "say "It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.""
alias pride1019 "say "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother, "because he"
alias pride1020 "say does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you,"
alias pride1021 "say Darcy?""
alias pride1022 "say "My style of writing is very different from yours.""
alias pride1023 "say "Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He"
alias pride1024 "say leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.""
alias pride1025 "say "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by which means my"
alias pride1026 "say letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.""
alias pride1027 "say "Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof.""
alias pride1028 "say "Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility. It is often only"
alias pride1029 "say carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.""
alias pride1030 "say "And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?""
alias pride1031 "say "The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you"
alias pride1032 "say consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution,"
alias pride1033 "say which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything"
alias pride1034 "say with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to"
alias pride1035 "say the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you"
alias pride1036 "say ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to"
alias pride1037 "say be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in "
alias pride1038 "say a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real"
alias pride1039 "say advantage to yourself or anyone else?""
alias pride1040 "say "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that"
alias pride1041 "say were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be"
alias pride1042 "say true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of"
alias pride1043 "say needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.""
alias pride1044 "say "I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with"
alias pride1045 "say such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I"
alias pride1046 "say know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had"
alias pride1047 "say better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go—and at"
alias pride1048 "say another word, might stay a month.""
alias pride1049 "say "You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to"
alias pride1050 "say his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.""
alias pride1051 "say "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into"
alias pride1052 "say a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which"
alias pride1053 "say that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under"
alias pride1054 "say such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.""
alias pride1055 "say "Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by"
alias pride1056 "say your obstinacy in adhering to it?""
alias pride1057 "say "Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself.""
alias pride1058 "say "You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have"
alias pride1059 "say never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your"
alias pride1060 "say representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire"
alias pride1061 "say his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without"
alias pride1062 "say offering one argument in favour of its propriety.""
alias pride1063 "say "To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.""
alias pride1064 "say "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.""
alias pride1065 "say "You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and"
alias pride1066 "say affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request,"
alias pride1067 "say without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a"
alias pride1068 "say case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the"
alias pride1069 "say circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in"
alias pride1070 "say general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the"
alias pride1071 "say other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for"
alias pride1072 "say complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?""
alias pride1073 "say "Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more"
alias pride1074 "say precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the"
alias pride1075 "say degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?" "
alias pride1076 "say "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their"
alias pride1077 "say comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet,"
alias pride1078 "say than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in"
alias pride1079 "say comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not"
alias pride1080 "say know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at"
alias pride1081 "say his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.""
alias pride1082 "say Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended,"
alias pride1083 "say and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had"
alias pride1084 "say received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense."
alias pride1085 "say "I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. "You dislike an argument, and want to"
alias pride1086 "say silence this.""
alias pride1087 "say "Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer"
alias pride1088 "say yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you"
alias pride1089 "say like of me.""
alias pride1090 "say "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much"
alias pride1091 "say better finish his letter.""
alias pride1092 "say Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter."
alias pride1093 "say When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence"
alias pride1094 "say of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite"
alias pride1095 "say request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly"
alias pride1096 "say negatived, she seated herself."
alias pride1097 "say Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not"
alias pride1098 "say help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how"
alias pride1099 "say frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she"
alias pride1100 "say could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her"
alias pride1101 "say because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last"
alias pride1102 "say that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible,"
alias pride1103 "say according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not"
alias pride1104 "say pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation."
alias pride1105 "say After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air;"
alias pride1106 "say and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her:"
alias pride1107 "say "Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing"
alias pride1108 "say a reel?""
alias pride1109 "say She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her"
alias pride1110 "say silence."
alias pride1111 "say "Oh!" said she, "I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in"
alias pride1112 "say reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising"
alias pride1113 "say my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person "
alias pride1114 "say of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not"
alias pride1115 "say want to dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare.""
alias pride1116 "say "Indeed I do not dare.""
alias pride1117 "say Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there"
alias pride1118 "say was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to"
alias pride1119 "say affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her."
alias pride1120 "say He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in"
alias pride1121 "say some danger."
alias pride1122 "say Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the"
alias pride1123 "say recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of"
alias pride1124 "say Elizabeth."
alias pride1125 "say She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed"
alias pride1126 "say marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance."
alias pride1127 "say "I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will"
alias pride1128 "say give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the"
alias pride1129 "say advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of"
alias pride1130 "say running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that"
alias pride1131 "say little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.""
alias pride1132 "say "Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?""
alias pride1133 "say "Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at"
alias pride1134 "say Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession,"
alias pride1135 "say you know, only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it"
alias pride1136 "say taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?""
alias pride1137 "say "It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and"
alias pride1138 "say the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.""
alias pride1139 "say At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself."
alias pride1140 "say "I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest"
alias pride1141 "say they had been overheard."
alias pride1142 "say "You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "running away without telling us"
alias pride1143 "say that you were coming out.""
alias pride1144 "say Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The"
alias pride1145 "say path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:"
alias pride1146 "say "This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue.""
alias pride1147 "say But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly"
alias pride1148 "say answered:"
alias pride1149 "say "No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon"
alias pride1150 "say advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye." "
alias pride1151 "say She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again"
alias pride1152 "say in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a"
alias pride1153 "say couple of hours that evening."
alias pride1154 "say Chapter 11"
alias pride1155 "say When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well"
alias pride1156 "say guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her"
alias pride1157 "say two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so"
alias pride1158 "say agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their"
alias pride1159 "say powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with"
alias pride1160 "say accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit."
alias pride1161 "say But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes"
alias pride1162 "say were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had"
alias pride1163 "say advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation;"
alias pride1164 "say Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and"
alias pride1165 "say warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first halfhour"
alias pride1166 "say was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she"
alias pride1167 "say removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the"
alias pride1168 "say door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the"
alias pride1169 "say opposite corner, saw it all with great delight."
alias pride1170 "say When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table—but in vain."
alias pride1171 "say She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst"
alias pride1172 "say soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play,"
alias pride1173 "say and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had"
alias pride1174 "say therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy"
alias pride1175 "say took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing"
alias pride1176 "say with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss"
alias pride1177 "say Bennet."
alias pride1178 "say Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress"
alias pride1179 "say through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some"
alias pride1180 "say inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he"
alias pride1181 "say merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be"
alias pride1182 "say amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of"
alias pride1183 "say his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I"
alias pride1184 "say declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything"
alias pride1185 "say than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an"
alias pride1186 "say excellent library." "
alias pride1187 "say No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes"
alias pride1188 "say round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball"
alias pride1189 "say to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:"
alias pride1190 "say "By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would"
alias pride1191 "say advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am"
alias pride1192 "say much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a"
alias pride1193 "say punishment than a pleasure.""
alias pride1194 "say "If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it"
alias pride1195 "say begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made"
alias pride1196 "say white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.""
alias pride1197 "say "I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different"
alias pride1198 "say manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting."
alias pride1199 "say It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the"
alias pride1200 "say order of the day.""
alias pride1201 "say "Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like"
alias pride1202 "say a ball.""
alias pride1203 "say Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the"
alias pride1204 "say room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed,"
alias pride1205 "say was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort"
alias pride1206 "say more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:"
alias pride1207 "say "Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the"
alias pride1208 "say room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.""
alias pride1209 "say Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in"
alias pride1210 "say the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of"
alias pride1211 "say attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book."
alias pride1212 "say He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could"
alias pride1213 "say imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with"
alias pride1214 "say either of which motives his joining them would interfere. "What could he mean? She was"
alias pride1215 "say dying to know what could be his meaning?"—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all"
alias pride1216 "say understand him?"
alias pride1217 "say "Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our"
alias pride1218 "say surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.""
alias pride1219 "say Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything, and"
alias pride1220 "say persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives."
alias pride1221 "say "I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed"
alias pride1222 "say him to speak. "You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in"
alias pride1223 "say each other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that"
alias pride1224 "say your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely"
alias pride1225 "say in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire." "
alias pride1226 "say "Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard anything so abominable. How shall"
alias pride1227 "say we punish him for such a speech?""
alias pride1228 "say "Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "We can all plague and"
alias pride1229 "say punish one another. Tease him—laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is"
alias pride1230 "say to be done.""
alias pride1231 "say "But upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me"
alias pride1232 "say that. Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there."
alias pride1233 "say And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh"
alias pride1234 "say without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.""
alias pride1235 "say "Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is an uncommon advantage,"
alias pride1236 "say and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such"
alias pride1237 "say acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh.""
alias pride1238 "say "Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me more credit than can be. The wisest and the best"
alias pride1239 "say of men—nay, the wisest and best of their actions—may be rendered ridiculous by a person"
alias pride1240 "say whose first object in life is a joke.""
alias pride1241 "say "Certainly," replied Elizabeth—"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I"
alias pride1242 "say hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and"
alias pride1243 "say inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I"
alias pride1244 "say suppose, are precisely what you are without.""
alias pride1245 "say "Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid"
alias pride1246 "say those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.""
alias pride1247 "say "Such as vanity and pride.""
alias pride1248 "say "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real superiority of mind,"
alias pride1249 "say pride will be always under good regulation.""
alias pride1250 "say Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile."
alias pride1251 "say "Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley; "and pray what"
alias pride1252 "say is the result?""
alias pride1253 "say "I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without"
alias pride1254 "say disguise.""
alias pride1255 "say "No," said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are"
alias pride1256 "say not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little"
alias pride1257 "say yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and"
alias pride1258 "say vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not"
alias pride1259 "say puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called"
alias pride1260 "say resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.""
alias pride1261 "say "That is a failing indeed!" cried Elizabeth. "Implacable resentment is a shade in a"
alias pride1262 "say character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh at it. You are safe"
alias pride1263 "say from me." "
alias pride1264 "say "There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil—a natural"
alias pride1265 "say defect, which not even the best education can overcome.""
alias pride1266 "say "And your defect is to hate everybody.""
alias pride1267 "say "And yours," he replied with a smile, "is willfully to misunderstand them.""
alias pride1268 "say "Do let us have a little music," cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she"
alias pride1269 "say had no share. "Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?""
alias pride1270 "say Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after"
alias pride1271 "say a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying"
alias pride1272 "say Elizabeth too much attention."
alias pride1273 "say Chapter 12"
alias pride1274 "say In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to"
alias pride1275 "say their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But"
alias pride1276 "say Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the"
alias pride1277 "say following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to"
alias pride1278 "say receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to"
alias pride1279 "say Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they"
alias pride1280 "say could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that"
alias pride1281 "say if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well."
alias pride1282 "say Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did she much"
alias pride1283 "say expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding"
alias pride1284 "say themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately,"
alias pride1285 "say and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning"
alias pride1286 "say should be mentioned, and the request made."
alias pride1287 "say The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of"
alias pride1288 "say wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their"
alias pride1289 "say going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her"
alias pride1290 "say jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other."
alias pride1291 "say The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and"
alias pride1292 "say repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her—that she was not"
alias pride1293 "say enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right."
alias pride1294 "say To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long"
alias pride1295 "say enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and"
alias pride1296 "say more teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign"
alias pride1297 "say of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of"
alias pride1298 "say influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour"
alias pride1299 "say during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his "
alias pride1300 "say purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they"
alias pride1301 "say were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his"
alias pride1302 "say book, and would not even look at her."
alias pride1303 "say On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place."
alias pride1304 "say Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for"
alias pride1305 "say Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her"
alias pride1306 "say to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even"
alias pride1307 "say shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of"
alias pride1308 "say spirits."
alias pride1309 "say They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at"
alias pride1310 "say their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane"
alias pride1311 "say would have caught cold again. But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of"
alias pride1312 "say pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The"
alias pride1313 "say evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and"
alias pride1314 "say almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth."
alias pride1315 "say They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and"
alias pride1316 "say had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to."
alias pride1317 "say Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done and"
alias pride1318 "say much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers"
alias pride1319 "say had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted"
alias pride1320 "say that Colonel Forster was going to be married."
alias pride1321 "say Chapter 13"
alias pride1322 "say "I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next"
alias pride1323 "say morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an"
alias pride1324 "say addition to our family party.""
alias pride1325 "say "Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless"
alias pride1326 "say Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in—and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I"
alias pride1327 "say do not believe she often sees such at home.""
alias pride1328 "say "The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.""
alias pride1329 "say Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure!"
alias pride1330 "say Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But—good Lord! how"
alias pride1331 "say unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell—I must"
alias pride1332 "say speak to Hill this moment.""
alias pride1333 "say "It is not Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole"
alias pride1334 "say course of my life." "
alias pride1335 "say This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned"
alias pride1336 "say by his wife and his five daughters at once."
alias pride1337 "say After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:"
alias pride1338 "say "About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I"
alias pride1339 "say thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr."
alias pride1340 "say Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.""
alias pride1341 "say "Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of"
alias pride1342 "say that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be"
alias pride1343 "say entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried"
alias pride1344 "say long ago to do something or other about it.""
alias pride1345 "say Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often"
alias pride1346 "say attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach"
alias pride1347 "say of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away"
alias pride1348 "say from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about."
alias pride1349 "say "It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr."
alias pride1350 "say Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may"
alias pride1351 "say perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.""
alias pride1352 "say "No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at"
alias pride1353 "say all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling"
alias pride1354 "say with you, as his father did before him?""
alias pride1355 "say "Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will"
alias pride1356 "say hear.""
alias pride1357 "say "Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October."
alias pride1358 "say "Dear Sir,—"
alias pride1359 "say "The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave"
alias pride1360 "say me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently"
alias pride1361 "say wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest"
alias pride1362 "say it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with"
alias pride1363 "say whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.—'There, Mrs. Bennet.'—My mind,"
alias pride1364 "say however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have"
alias pride1365 "say been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady"
alias pride1366 "say Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has"
alias pride1367 "say preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to"
alias pride1368 "say demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform"
alias pride1369 "say those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,"
alias pride1370 "say moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families"
alias pride1371 "say within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present"
alias pride1372 "say overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail"
alias pride1373 "say of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the"
alias pride1374 "say offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring "
alias pride1375 "say your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my"
alias pride1376 "say readiness to make them every possible amends—but of this hereafter. If you should have no"
alias pride1377 "say objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you"
alias pride1378 "say and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on"
alias pride1379 "say your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following, which I can do without any"
alias pride1380 "say inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a"
alias pride1381 "say Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I"
alias pride1382 "say remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher"
alias pride1383 "say and friend,"
alias pride1384 "say "WILLIAM COLLINS""
alias pride1385 "say "At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr."
alias pride1386 "say Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young"
alias pride1387 "say man, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady"
alias pride1388 "say Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.""
alias pride1389 "say "There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is disposed to"
alias pride1390 "say make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.""
alias pride1391 "say "Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the"
alias pride1392 "say atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.""
alias pride1393 "say Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his"
alias pride1394 "say kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were"
alias pride1395 "say required."
alias pride1396 "say "He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him out.—There is something"
alias pride1397 "say very pompous in his style.—And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the"
alias pride1398 "say entail?—We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.—Could he be a sensible man,"
alias pride1399 "say sir?""
alias pride1400 "say "No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a"
alias pride1401 "say mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to"
alias pride1402 "say see him.""
alias pride1403 "say "In point of composition," said Mary, "the letter does not seem defective. The idea of the"
alias pride1404 "say olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.""
alias pride1405 "say To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It"
alias pride1406 "say was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some"
alias pride1407 "say weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As"
alias pride1408 "say for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was"
alias pride1409 "say preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and"
alias pride1410 "say daughters."
alias pride1411 "say Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole"
alias pride1412 "say family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr."
alias pride1413 "say Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was"
alias pride1414 "say a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his "
alias pride1415 "say manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs."
alias pride1416 "say Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but"
alias pride1417 "say that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her"
alias pride1418 "say seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste"
alias pride1419 "say of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered"
alias pride1420 "say most readily."
alias pride1421 "say "You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they"
alias pride1422 "say will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.""
alias pride1423 "say "You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.""
alias pride1424 "say "Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I"
alias pride1425 "say mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no"
alias pride1426 "say knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.""
alias pride1427 "say "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on"
alias pride1428 "say the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the"
alias pride1429 "say young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but,"
alias pride1430 "say perhaps, when we are better acquainted—""
alias pride1431 "say He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They"
alias pride1432 "say were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its"
alias pride1433 "say furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have"
alias pride1434 "say touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his"
alias pride1435 "say own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know"
alias pride1436 "say to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right"
alias pride1437 "say there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to"
alias pride1438 "say keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged"
alias pride1439 "say pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended;"
alias pride1440 "say but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour."
alias pride1441 "say Chapter 14"
alias pride1442 "say During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn,"
alias pride1443 "say he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject"
alias pride1444 "say in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his"
alias pride1445 "say patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his"
alias pride1446 "say comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins"
alias pride1447 "say was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of"
alias pride1448 "say manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that "he had never in his life"
alias pride1449 "say witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had"
alias pride1450 "say himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of"
alias pride1451 "say both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She "
alias pride1452 "say had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before,"
alias pride1453 "say to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by"
alias pride1454 "say many people he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always"
alias pride1455 "say spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to"
alias pride1456 "say his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for"
alias pride1457 "say a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as"
alias pride1458 "say soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his"
alias pride1459 "say humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making,"
alias pride1460 "say and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself—some shelves in the closet up stairs.""
alias pride1461 "say "That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and I dare say she is a"
alias pride1462 "say very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does"
alias pride1463 "say she live near you, sir?""
alias pride1464 "say "The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings"
alias pride1465 "say Park, her ladyship's residence.""
alias pride1466 "say "I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?""
alias pride1467 "say "She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.""
alias pride1468 "say "Ah!" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls. And"
alias pride1469 "say what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?""
alias pride1470 "say "She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of"
alias pride1471 "say true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is"
alias pride1472 "say that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately"
alias pride1473 "say of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many"
alias pride1474 "say accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the"
alias pride1475 "say lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly"
alias pride1476 "say amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and"
alias pride1477 "say ponies.""
alias pride1478 "say "Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.""
alias pride1479 "say "Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means,"
alias pride1480 "say as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament."
alias pride1481 "say Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every"
alias pride1482 "say occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I"
alias pride1483 "say have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born"
alias pride1484 "say to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would"
alias pride1485 "say be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a"
alias pride1486 "say sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.""
alias pride1487 "say "You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the"
alias pride1488 "say talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from"
alias pride1489 "say the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?" "
alias pride1490 "say "They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse"
alias pride1491 "say myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to"
alias pride1492 "say ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.""
alias pride1493 "say Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had"
alias pride1494 "say hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the"
alias pride1495 "say most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth,"
alias pride1496 "say requiring no partner in his pleasure."
alias pride1497 "say By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his"
alias pride1498 "say guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud"
alias pride1499 "say to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it"
alias pride1500 "say (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging"
alias pride1501 "say pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other"
alias pride1502 "say books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia"
alias pride1503 "say gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read"
alias pride1504 "say three pages, she interrupted him with:"
alias pride1505 "say "Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he"
alias pride1506 "say does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to"
alias pride1507 "say Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from"
alias pride1508 "say town.""
alias pride1509 "say Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much"
alias pride1510 "say offended, laid aside his book, and said:"
alias pride1511 "say "I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp,"
alias pride1512 "say though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be"
alias pride1513 "say nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young"
alias pride1514 "say cousin.""
alias pride1515 "say Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. Mr."
alias pride1516 "say Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to"
alias pride1517 "say their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for"
alias pride1518 "say Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his"
alias pride1519 "say book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and"
alias pride1520 "say should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr."
alias pride1521 "say Bennet, and prepared for backgammon."
alias pride1522 "say Chapter 15"
alias pride1523 "say Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little"
alias pride1524 "say assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the"
alias pride1525 "say guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the "
alias pride1526 "say universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful"
alias pride1527 "say acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him"
alias pride1528 "say originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit"
alias pride1529 "say of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and"
alias pride1530 "say unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de"
alias pride1531 "say Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high"
alias pride1532 "say rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of"
alias pride1533 "say himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a"
alias pride1534 "say mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility."
alias pride1535 "say Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in"
alias pride1536 "say seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to"
alias pride1537 "say choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were"
alias pride1538 "say represented by common report. This was his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting"
alias pride1539 "say their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness,"
alias pride1540 "say and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part."
alias pride1541 "say His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and"
alias pride1542 "say established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she"
alias pride1543 "say was his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an"
alias pride1544 "say hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his"
alias pride1545 "say parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be"
alias pride1546 "say found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general"
alias pride1547 "say encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. "As to her younger"
alias pride1548 "say daughters, she could not take upon her to say—she could not positively answer—but she"
alias pride1549 "say did not know of any prepossession; her eldest daughter, she must just mention—she felt it"
alias pride1550 "say incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.""
alias pride1551 "say Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was soon done—done"
alias pride1552 "say while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty,"
alias pride1553 "say succeeded her of course."
alias pride1554 "say Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters"
alias pride1555 "say married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in"
alias pride1556 "say her good graces."
alias pride1557 "say Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary"
alias pride1558 "say agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet,"
alias pride1559 "say who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr."
alias pride1560 "say Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged"
alias pride1561 "say with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little"
alias pride1562 "say cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet"
alias pride1563 "say exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though"
alias pride1564 "say prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the"
alias pride1565 "say house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in"
alias pride1566 "say inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much"
alias pride1567 "say better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and"
alias pride1568 "say go. "
alias pride1569 "say In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time"
alias pride1570 "say passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be"
alias pride1571 "say gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the"
alias pride1572 "say officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop"
alias pride1573 "say window, could recall them."
alias pride1574 "say But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never"
alias pride1575 "say seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other"
alias pride1576 "say side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London"
alias pride1577 "say Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air,"
alias pride1578 "say all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led"
alias pride1579 "say the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and"
alias pride1580 "say fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had"
alias pride1581 "say reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to"
alias pride1582 "say introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town,"
alias pride1583 "say and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it"
alias pride1584 "say should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming."
alias pride1585 "say His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine"
alias pride1586 "say countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on"
alias pride1587 "say his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same time perfectly"
alias pride1588 "say correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very"
alias pride1589 "say agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen"
alias pride1590 "say riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came"
alias pride1591 "say directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman,"
alias pride1592 "say and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on"
alias pride1593 "say purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to"
alias pride1594 "say determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of"
alias pride1595 "say the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each"
alias pride1596 "say other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked"
alias pride1597 "say white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat—a salutation"
alias pride1598 "say which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible"
alias pride1599 "say to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know."
alias pride1600 "say In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took"
alias pride1601 "say leave and rode on with his friend."
alias pride1602 "say Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip's"
alias pride1603 "say house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they"
alias pride1604 "say should come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and"
alias pride1605 "say loudly seconding the invitation."
alias pride1606 "say Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent"
alias pride1607 "say absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their"
alias pride1608 "say sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have"
alias pride1609 "say known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the street, who"
alias pride1610 "say had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss"
alias pride1611 "say Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's"
alias pride1612 "say introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with "
alias pride1613 "say as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her,"
alias pride1614 "say which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to"
alias pride1615 "say the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an"
alias pride1616 "say excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by"
alias pride1617 "say exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her"
alias pride1618 "say nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he"
alias pride1619 "say was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ——shire. She had been watching him the last"
alias pride1620 "say hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty"
alias pride1621 "say and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed"
alias pride1622 "say windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were"
alias pride1623 "say become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses the"
alias pride1624 "say next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him"
alias pride1625 "say an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was"
alias pride1626 "say agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game"
alias pride1627 "say of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was"
alias pride1628 "say very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in"
alias pride1629 "say quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly"
alias pride1630 "say needless."
alias pride1631 "say As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two"
alias pride1632 "say gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in"
alias pride1633 "say the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister."
alias pride1634 "say Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips's"
alias pride1635 "say manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had"
alias pride1636 "say never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost"
alias pride1637 "say civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although"
alias pride1638 "say utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his"
alias pride1639 "say connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course"
alias pride1640 "say of his life."
alias pride1641 "say Chapter 16"
alias pride1642 "say As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr."
alias pride1643 "say Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were"
alias pride1644 "say most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to"
alias pride1645 "say Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that"
alias pride1646 "say Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house."
alias pride1647 "say When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at"
alias pride1648 "say leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and"
alias pride1649 "say furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the"
alias pride1650 "say small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much "
alias pride1651 "say gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was"
alias pride1652 "say its proprietor—when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's"
alias pride1653 "say drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she"
alias pride1654 "say felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the"
alias pride1655 "say housekeeper's room."
alias pride1656 "say In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional"
alias pride1657 "say digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he"
alias pride1658 "say was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very"
alias pride1659 "say attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and"
alias pride1660 "say who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls,"
alias pride1661 "say who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an"
alias pride1662 "say instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the"
alias pride1663 "say interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did"
alias pride1664 "say approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither"
alias pride1665 "say been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable"
alias pride1666 "say admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike"
alias pride1667 "say set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond"
alias pride1668 "say them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced,"
alias pride1669 "say stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room."
alias pride1670 "say Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned,"
alias pride1671 "say and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable"
alias pride1672 "say manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a"
alias pride1673 "say wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be"
alias pride1674 "say rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker."
alias pride1675 "say With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins"
alias pride1676 "say seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had"
alias pride1677 "say still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most"
alias pride1678 "say abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the"
alias pride1679 "say opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist."
alias pride1680 "say "I know little of the game at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for"
alias pride1681 "say in my situation in life—" Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait"
alias pride1682 "say for his reason."
alias pride1683 "say Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other"
alias pride1684 "say table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him"
alias pride1685 "say entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery"
alias pride1686 "say tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and"
alias pride1687 "say exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common"
alias pride1688 "say demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she"
alias pride1689 "say was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to"
alias pride1690 "say be told—the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that"
alias pride1691 "say gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the"
alias pride1692 "say subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her"
alias pride1693 "say answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there. "
alias pride1694 "say "About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He"
alias pride1695 "say is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.""
alias pride1696 "say "Yes," replied Mr. Wickham; "his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per"
alias pride1697 "say annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain"
alias pride1698 "say information on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a"
alias pride1699 "say particular manner from my infancy.""
alias pride1700 "say Elizabeth could not but look surprised."
alias pride1701 "say "You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you"
alias pride1702 "say probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted"
alias pride1703 "say with Mr. Darcy?""
alias pride1704 "say "As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth very warmly. "I have spent four days in"
alias pride1705 "say the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.""
alias pride1706 "say "I have no right to give my opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or"
alias pride1707 "say otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a"
alias pride1708 "say fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would"
alias pride1709 "say in general astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else."
alias pride1710 "say Here you are in your own family.""
alias pride1711 "say "Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood,"
alias pride1712 "say except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his"
alias pride1713 "say pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.""
alias pride1714 "say "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that"
alias pride1715 "say any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not"
alias pride1716 "say often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his"
alias pride1717 "say high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.""
alias pride1718 "say "I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham"
alias pride1719 "say only shook his head."
alias pride1720 "say "I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this"
alias pride1721 "say country much longer.""
alias pride1722 "say "I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I"
alias pride1723 "say hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will not be affected by his being in the"
alias pride1724 "say neighbourhood.""
alias pride1725 "say "Oh! no—it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to avoid seeing"
alias pride1726 "say me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but"
alias pride1727 "say I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of"
alias pride1728 "say very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss"
alias pride1729 "say Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend"
alias pride1730 "say I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the"
alias pride1731 "say soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I "
alias pride1732 "say verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the"
alias pride1733 "say hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.""
alias pride1734 "say Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the"
alias pride1735 "say delicacy of it prevented further inquiry."
alias pride1736 "say Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the"
alias pride1737 "say society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter"
alias pride1738 "say with gentle but very intelligible gallantry."
alias pride1739 "say "It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my"
alias pride1740 "say chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps,"
alias pride1741 "say and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the"
alias pride1742 "say very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I"
alias pride1743 "say own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear"
alias pride1744 "say solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for,"
alias pride1745 "say but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my"
alias pride1746 "say profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in"
alias pride1747 "say possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just"
alias pride1748 "say now.""
alias pride1749 "say "Indeed!""
alias pride1750 "say "Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his"
alias pride1751 "say gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his"
alias pride1752 "say kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the"
alias pride1753 "say living fell, it was given elsewhere.""
alias pride1754 "say "Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could that be? How could his will be"
alias pride1755 "say disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?""
alias pride1756 "say "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope"
alias pride1757 "say from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to"
alias pride1758 "say doubt it—or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had"
alias pride1759 "say forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence—in short anything or nothing. Certain"
alias pride1760 "say it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and"
alias pride1761 "say that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of"
alias pride1762 "say having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I"
alias pride1763 "say may have spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But"
alias pride1764 "say the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.""
alias pride1765 "say "This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.""
alias pride1766 "say "Some time or other he will be—but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget his father, I"
alias pride1767 "say can never defy or expose him.""
alias pride1768 "say Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he"
alias pride1769 "say expressed them. "
alias pride1770 "say "But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive? What can have induced"
alias pride1771 "say him to behave so cruelly?""
alias pride1772 "say "A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some"
alias pride1773 "say measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with"
alias pride1774 "say me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in"
alias pride1775 "say life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—the sort of"
alias pride1776 "say preference which was often given me.""
alias pride1777 "say "I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked him. I had not"
alias pride1778 "say thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in"
alias pride1779 "say general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice,"
alias pride1780 "say such inhumanity as this.""
alias pride1781 "say After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, "I do remember his boasting one"
alias pride1782 "say day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving"
alias pride1783 "say temper. His disposition must be dreadful.""
alias pride1784 "say "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; "I can hardly be just to him.""
alias pride1785 "say Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a"
alias pride1786 "say manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!" She could have added, "A young"
alias pride1787 "say man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"—but she"
alias pride1788 "say contented herself with, "and one, too, who had probably been his companion from"
alias pride1789 "say childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!""
alias pride1790 "say "We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth"
alias pride1791 "say was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of"
alias pride1792 "say the same parental care. My father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr."
alias pride1793 "say Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—but he gave up everything to be of use to the late"
alias pride1794 "say Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most"
alias pride1795 "say highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often"
alias pride1796 "say acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active"
alias pride1797 "say superintendence, and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a"
alias pride1798 "say voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of"
alias pride1799 "say gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself.""
alias pride1800 "say "How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this"
alias pride1801 "say Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have"
alias pride1802 "say been too proud to be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it.""
alias pride1803 "say "It is wonderful," replied Wickham, "for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;"
alias pride1804 "say and pride had often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with"
alias pride1805 "say any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were"
alias pride1806 "say stronger impulses even than pride.""
alias pride1807 "say "Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?""
alias pride1808 "say "Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display"
alias pride1809 "say hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride—for he "
alias pride1810 "say is very proud of what his father was—have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,"
alias pride1811 "say to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a"
alias pride1812 "say powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes"
alias pride1813 "say him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up"
alias pride1814 "say as the most attentive and best of brothers.""
alias pride1815 "say "What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?""
alias pride1816 "say He shook his head. "I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a"
alias pride1817 "say Darcy. But she is too much like her brother—very, very proud. As a child, she was"
alias pride1818 "say affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to"
alias pride1819 "say her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or"
alias pride1820 "say sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her home has been"
alias pride1821 "say London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.""
alias pride1822 "say After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting"
alias pride1823 "say once more to the first, and saying:"
alias pride1824 "say "I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems"
alias pride1825 "say good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?"
alias pride1826 "say How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?""
alias pride1827 "say "Not at all.""
alias pride1828 "say "He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.""
alias pride1829 "say "Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities."
alias pride1830 "say He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at"
alias pride1831 "say all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less"
alias pride1832 "say prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere,"
alias pride1833 "say rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure.""
alias pride1834 "say The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table"
alias pride1835 "say and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual"
alias pride1836 "say inquiries as to his success was made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost"
alias pride1837 "say every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her"
alias pride1838 "say with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the"
alias pride1839 "say money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy."
alias pride1840 "say "I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card-table, they"
alias pride1841 "say must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to"
alias pride1842 "say make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same,"
alias pride1843 "say but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of"
alias pride1844 "say regarding little matters.""
alias pride1845 "say Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments,"
alias pride1846 "say he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with"
alias pride1847 "say the family of de Bourgh. "
alias pride1848 "say "Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living. I hardly"
alias pride1849 "say know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her"
alias pride1850 "say long.""
alias pride1851 "say "You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters;"
alias pride1852 "say consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.""
alias pride1853 "say "No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections. I never"
alias pride1854 "say heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.""
alias pride1855 "say "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she"
alias pride1856 "say and her cousin will unite the two estates.""
alias pride1857 "say This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed"
alias pride1858 "say must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of"
alias pride1859 "say himself, if he were already self-destined for another."
alias pride1860 "say "Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but"
alias pride1861 "say from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads"
alias pride1862 "say him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.""
alias pride1863 "say "I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for"
alias pride1864 "say many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were"
alias pride1865 "say dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but"
alias pride1866 "say I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her"
alias pride1867 "say authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that"
alias pride1868 "say everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.""
alias pride1869 "say Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued"
alias pride1870 "say talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of"
alias pride1871 "say the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the"
alias pride1872 "say noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody."
alias pride1873 "say Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went"
alias pride1874 "say away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of"
alias pride1875 "say what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his"
alias pride1876 "say name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked"
alias pride1877 "say incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr."
alias pride1878 "say Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the"
alias pride1879 "say least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing"
alias pride1880 "say that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage"
alias pride1881 "say stopped at Longbourn House."
alias pride1882 "say Chapter 17 "
alias pride1883 "say Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and"
alias pride1884 "say herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr."
alias pride1885 "say Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to"
alias pride1886 "say question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The"
alias pride1887 "say possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender"
alias pride1888 "say feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to"
alias pride1889 "say defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever"
alias pride1890 "say could not be otherwise explained."
alias pride1891 "say "They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which"
alias pride1892 "say we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is,"
alias pride1893 "say in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have"
alias pride1894 "say alienated them, without actual blame on either side.""
alias pride1895 "say "Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the"
alias pride1896 "say interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear them too, or"
alias pride1897 "say we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.""
alias pride1898 "say "Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest"
alias pride1899 "say Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his"
alias pride1900 "say father's favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is"
alias pride1901 "say impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character,"
alias pride1902 "say could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh!"
alias pride1903 "say no.""
alias pride1904 "say "I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham"
alias pride1905 "say should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything"
alias pride1906 "say mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was"
alias pride1907 "say truth in his looks.""
alias pride1908 "say "It is difficult indeed—it is distressing. One does not know what to think.""
alias pride1909 "say "I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.""
alias pride1910 "say But Jane could think with certainty on only one point—that Mr. Bingley, if he had been"
alias pride1911 "say imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public."
alias pride1912 "say The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation"
alias pride1913 "say passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and"
alias pride1914 "say his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield,"
alias pride1915 "say which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear"
alias pride1916 "say friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been"
alias pride1917 "say doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;"
alias pride1918 "say avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all"
alias pride1919 "say to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took"
alias pride1920 "say their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities."
alias pride1921 "say The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the"
alias pride1922 "say family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and"
alias pride1923 "say was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a "
alias pride1924 "say ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends,"
alias pride1925 "say and the attentions of her brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great"
alias pride1926 "say deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and"
alias pride1927 "say behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single"
alias pride1928 "say event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the"
alias pride1929 "say evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them,"
alias pride1930 "say and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no"
alias pride1931 "say disinclination for it."
alias pride1932 "say "While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough—I think it is no"
alias pride1933 "say sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I"
alias pride1934 "say profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as"
alias pride1935 "say desirable for everybody.""
alias pride1936 "say Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak"
alias pride1937 "say unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept"
alias pride1938 "say Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the"
alias pride1939 "say evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple"
alias pride1940 "say whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop,"
alias pride1941 "say or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance."
alias pride1942 "say "I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given"
alias pride1943 "say by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so"
alias pride1944 "say far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all"
alias pride1945 "say my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,"
alias pride1946 "say Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin"
alias pride1947 "say Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.""
alias pride1948 "say Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr."
alias pride1949 "say Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never"
alias pride1950 "say been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her"
alias pride1951 "say own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good"
alias pride1952 "say a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it"
alias pride1953 "say suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that she was selected from among her"
alias pride1954 "say sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a"
alias pride1955 "say quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to"
alias pride1956 "say conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent"
alias pride1957 "say attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified"
alias pride1958 "say herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to"
alias pride1959 "say understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her. Elizabeth,"
alias pride1960 "say however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the"
alias pride1961 "say consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was"
alias pride1962 "say useless to quarrel about him."
alias pride1963 "say If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss"
alias pride1964 "say Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the"
alias pride1965 "say invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their"
alias pride1966 "say walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after—the very "
alias pride1967 "say shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial"
alias pride1968 "say of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance"
alias pride1969 "say with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a"
alias pride1970 "say Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia."
alias pride1971 "say Chapter 18"
alias pride1972 "say Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr."
alias pride1973 "say Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had"
alias pride1974 "say never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those"
alias pride1975 "say recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than"
alias pride1976 "say usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained"
alias pride1977 "say unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the"
alias pride1978 "say evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for"
alias pride1979 "say Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not"
alias pride1980 "say exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to"
alias pride1981 "say whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to"
alias pride1982 "say town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,"
alias pride1983 "say "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted"
alias pride1984 "say to avoid a certain gentleman here.""
alias pride1985 "say This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it"
alias pride1986 "say assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first"
alias pride1987 "say surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by"
alias pride1988 "say immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite"
alias pride1989 "say inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance,"
alias pride1990 "say patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of"
alias pride1991 "say conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not"
alias pride1992 "say wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her."
alias pride1993 "say But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was"
alias pride1994 "say destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her"
alias pride1995 "say griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a"
alias pride1996 "say voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular"
alias pride1997 "say notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of"
alias pride1998 "say mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often"
alias pride1999 "say moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a"
alias pride2000 "say disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him"
alias pride2001 "say was ecstasy."
alias pride2002 "say She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of"
alias pride2003 "say hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to"
alias pride2004 "say Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly "
alias pride2005 "say addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand,"
alias pride2006 "say that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately,"
alias pride2007 "say and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console"
alias pride2008 "say her:"
alias pride2009 "say "I dare say you will find him very agreeable.""
alias pride2010 "say "Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable"
alias pride2011 "say whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil.""
alias pride2012 "say When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand,"
alias pride2013 "say Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her"
alias pride2014 "say fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his"
alias pride2015 "say consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity"
alias pride2016 "say to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in"
alias pride2017 "say her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time"
alias pride2018 "say without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the"
alias pride2019 "say two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be"
alias pride2020 "say the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight"
alias pride2021 "say observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes,"
alias pride2022 "say she addressed him a second time with:—"It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I"
alias pride2023 "say talked about the dance, and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room,"
alias pride2024 "say or the number of couples.""
alias pride2025 "say He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said."
alias pride2026 "say "Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that"
alias pride2027 "say private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But now we may be silent.""
alias pride2028 "say "Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?""
alias pride2029 "say "Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent"
alias pride2030 "say for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so"
alias pride2031 "say arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.""
alias pride2032 "say "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are"
alias pride2033 "say gratifying mine?""
alias pride2034 "say "Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of"
alias pride2035 "say our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we"
alias pride2036 "say expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity"
alias pride2037 "say with all the eclat of a proverb.""
alias pride2038 "say "This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he. "How"
alias pride2039 "say near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.""
alias pride2040 "say "I must not decide on my own performance.""
alias pride2041 "say He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when"
alias pride2042 "say he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the "
alias pride2043 "say affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other"
alias pride2044 "say day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.""
alias pride2045 "say The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said"
alias pride2046 "say not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on."
alias pride2047 "say At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham is blessed with"
alias pride2048 "say such happy manners as may ensure his making friends—whether he may be equally capable"
alias pride2049 "say of retaining them, is less certain.""
alias pride2050 "say "He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis,"
alias pride2051 "say "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.""
alias pride2052 "say Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment, Sir"
alias pride2053 "say William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of"
alias pride2054 "say the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to"
alias pride2055 "say compliment him on his dancing and his partner."
alias pride2056 "say "I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior dancing is not"
alias pride2057 "say often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that"
alias pride2058 "say your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often"
alias pride2059 "say repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and"
alias pride2060 "say Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—"
alias pride2061 "say but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the"
alias pride2062 "say bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.""
alias pride2063 "say The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to"
alias pride2064 "say his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious"
alias pride2065 "say expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself,"
alias pride2066 "say however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "Sir William's interruption has made me"
alias pride2067 "say forget what we were talking of.""
alias pride2068 "say "I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted two"
alias pride2069 "say people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects"
alias pride2070 "say already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.""
alias pride2071 "say "What think you of books?" said he, smiling."
alias pride2072 "say "Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.""
alias pride2073 "say "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject."
alias pride2074 "say We may compare our different opinions.""
alias pride2075 "say "No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.""
alias pride2076 "say "The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?" said he, with a look of"
alias pride2077 "say doubt."
alias pride2078 "say "Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had"
alias pride2079 "say wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I"
alias pride2080 "say remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your "
alias pride2081 "say resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being"
alias pride2082 "say created.""
alias pride2083 "say "I am," said he, with a firm voice."
alias pride2084 "say "And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?""
alias pride2085 "say "I hope not.""
alias pride2086 "say "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of"
alias pride2087 "say judging properly at first.""
alias pride2088 "say "May I ask to what these questions tend?""
alias pride2089 "say "Merely to the illustration of your character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her"
alias pride2090 "say gravity. "I am trying to make it out.""
alias pride2091 "say "And what is your success?""
alias pride2092 "say She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle"
alias pride2093 "say me exceedingly.""
alias pride2094 "say "I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that reports may vary greatly with respect"
alias pride2095 "say to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the"
alias pride2096 "say present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on"
alias pride2097 "say either.""
alias pride2098 "say "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.""
alias pride2099 "say "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied. She said no"
alias pride2100 "say more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side"
alias pride2101 "say dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable"
alias pride2102 "say powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger"
alias pride2103 "say against another."
alias pride2104 "say They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an"
alias pride2105 "say expression of civil disdain accosted her:"
alias pride2106 "say "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your sister has"
alias pride2107 "say been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young"
alias pride2108 "say man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old"
alias pride2109 "say Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not"
alias pride2110 "say to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is"
alias pride2111 "say perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though"
alias pride2112 "say George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the"
alias pride2113 "say particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot"
alias pride2114 "say bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could"
alias pride2115 "say not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find"
alias pride2116 "say that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most"
alias pride2117 "say insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, "
alias pride2118 "say for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not"
alias pride2119 "say expect much better.""
alias pride2120 "say "His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily;"
alias pride2121 "say "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's"
alias pride2122 "say steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself.""
alias pride2123 "say "I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. "Excuse my"
alias pride2124 "say interference—it was kindly meant.""
alias pride2125 "say "Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much mistaken if you expect to"
alias pride2126 "say influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful"
alias pride2127 "say ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who has"
alias pride2128 "say undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of"
alias pride2129 "say such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well"
alias pride2130 "say she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings,"
alias pride2131 "say and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything"
alias pride2132 "say else, gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness."
alias pride2133 "say "I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what"
alias pride2134 "say you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to"
alias pride2135 "say think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.""
alias pride2136 "say "No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you."
alias pride2137 "say Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the"
alias pride2138 "say circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good"
alias pride2139 "say conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham"
alias pride2140 "say has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to"
alias pride2141 "say say by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young"
alias pride2142 "say man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.""
alias pride2143 "say "Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?""
alias pride2144 "say "No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.""
alias pride2145 "say "This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does"
alias pride2146 "say he say of the living?""
alias pride2147 "say "He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr."
alias pride2148 "say Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only.""
alias pride2149 "say "I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must"
alias pride2150 "say excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley's defense of his friend was"
alias pride2151 "say a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and"
alias pride2152 "say has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as"
alias pride2153 "say I did before.""
alias pride2154 "say She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could"
alias pride2155 "say be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest"
alias pride2156 "say hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten "
alias pride2157 "say her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to"
alias pride2158 "say Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely"
alias pride2159 "say replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had"
alias pride2160 "say just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery."
alias pride2161 "say "I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near"
alias pride2162 "say relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the"
alias pride2163 "say young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and"
alias pride2164 "say of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would"
alias pride2165 "say have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this"
alias pride2166 "say assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects"
alias pride2167 "say to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before."
alias pride2168 "say My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.""
alias pride2169 "say "You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!""
alias pride2170 "say "Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be"
alias pride2171 "say Lady Catherine's nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite"
alias pride2172 "say well yesterday se'nnight.""
alias pride2173 "say Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy"
alias pride2174 "say would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather"
alias pride2175 "say than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any"
alias pride2176 "say notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in"
alias pride2177 "say consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air"
alias pride2178 "say of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus:"
alias pride2179 "say "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent"
alias pride2180 "say judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that"
alias pride2181 "say there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the"
alias pride2182 "say laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the"
alias pride2183 "say clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided"
alias pride2184 "say that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore"
alias pride2185 "say allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to"
alias pride2186 "say perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your"
alias pride2187 "say advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before"
alias pride2188 "say us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right"
alias pride2189 "say than a young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose"
alias pride2190 "say reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so"
alias pride2191 "say addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though"
alias pride2192 "say she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips"
alias pride2193 "say the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh." It vexed her to see him"
alias pride2194 "say expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and"
alias pride2195 "say when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility."
alias pride2196 "say Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt"
alias pride2197 "say seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he"
alias pride2198 "say only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to"
alias pride2199 "say Elizabeth. "
alias pride2200 "say "I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy"
alias pride2201 "say seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even"
alias pride2202 "say paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's"
alias pride2203 "say discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a"
alias pride2204 "say very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.""
alias pride2205 "say As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention"
alias pride2206 "say almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which"
alias pride2207 "say her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in"
alias pride2208 "say idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could"
alias pride2209 "say bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like"
alias pride2210 "say Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and"
alias pride2211 "say she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down"
alias pride2212 "say to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them"
alias pride2213 "say within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to"
alias pride2214 "say that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that"
alias pride2215 "say Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet"
alias pride2216 "say seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such"
alias pride2217 "say a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first"
alias pride2218 "say points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters"
alias pride2219 "say were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could"
alias pride2220 "say do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying"
alias pride2221 "say so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her"
alias pride2222 "say time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she"
alias pride2223 "say might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this"
alias pride2224 "say circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one"
alias pride2225 "say was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life."
alias pride2226 "say She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate,"
alias pride2227 "say though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it."
alias pride2228 "say In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade"
alias pride2229 "say her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she"
alias pride2230 "say could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them."
alias pride2231 "say Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical."
alias pride2232 "say "What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no"
alias pride2233 "say such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.""
alias pride2234 "say "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr."
alias pride2235 "say Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!""
alias pride2236 "say Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her"
alias pride2237 "say views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and"
alias pride2238 "say vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance"
alias pride2239 "say convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she"
alias pride2240 "say was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face"
alias pride2241 "say changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity. "
alias pride2242 "say At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been"
alias pride2243 "say long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left"
alias pride2244 "say to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was"
alias pride2245 "say the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had"
alias pride2246 "say the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company."
alias pride2247 "say By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof"
alias pride2248 "say of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of"
alias pride2249 "say exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her"
alias pride2250 "say with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with"
alias pride2251 "say an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst"
alias pride2252 "say the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them"
alias pride2253 "say again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers were by no means"
alias pride2254 "say fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in"
alias pride2255 "say agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking"
alias pride2256 "say to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each"
alias pride2257 "say other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her father"
alias pride2258 "say to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when"
alias pride2259 "say Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "That will do extremely well, child. You"
alias pride2260 "say have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.""
alias pride2261 "say Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry"
alias pride2262 "say for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others"
alias pride2263 "say of the party were now applied to."
alias pride2264 "say "If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great"
alias pride2265 "say pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very"
alias pride2266 "say innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not"
alias pride2267 "say mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music,"
alias pride2268 "say for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do."
alias pride2269 "say In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself"
alias pride2270 "say and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains"
alias pride2271 "say will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling,"
alias pride2272 "say which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it"
alias pride2273 "say of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards"
alias pride2274 "say everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him"
alias pride2275 "say of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his"
alias pride2276 "say respect towards anybody connected with the family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he"
alias pride2277 "say concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room."
alias pride2278 "say Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself,"
alias pride2279 "say while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and"
alias pride2280 "say observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of"
alias pride2281 "say young man."
alias pride2282 "say To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as"
alias pride2283 "say much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their"
alias pride2284 "say parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister"
alias pride2285 "say that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to"
alias pride2286 "say be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. "
alias pride2287 "say Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad"
alias pride2288 "say enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the"
alias pride2289 "say insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable."
alias pride2290 "say The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by Mr. Collins, who"
alias pride2291 "say continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance"
alias pride2292 "say with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to"
alias pride2293 "say stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He"
alias pride2294 "say assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by"
alias pride2295 "say delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of"
alias pride2296 "say remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She"
alias pride2297 "say owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and goodnaturedly"
alias pride2298 "say engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself."
alias pride2299 "say She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice; though often"
alias pride2300 "say standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough"
alias pride2301 "say to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and"
alias pride2302 "say rejoiced in it."
alias pride2303 "say The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of"
alias pride2304 "say Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was"
alias pride2305 "say gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the"
alias pride2306 "say family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of"
alias pride2307 "say fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every"
alias pride2308 "say attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole"
alias pride2309 "say party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was"
alias pride2310 "say complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the"
alias pride2311 "say hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said"
alias pride2312 "say nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane"
alias pride2313 "say were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other."
alias pride2314 "say Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even"
alias pride2315 "say Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how"
alias pride2316 "say tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn."
alias pride2317 "say When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her"
alias pride2318 "say hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr."
alias pride2319 "say Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them"
alias pride2320 "say at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,"
alias pride2321 "say and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return"
alias pride2322 "say from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time."
alias pride2323 "say Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion"
alias pride2324 "say that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding"
alias pride2325 "say clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three"
alias pride2326 "say or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal"
alias pride2327 "say certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to"
alias pride2328 "say her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her,"
alias pride2329 "say the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield. "
alias pride2330 "say Chapter 19"
alias pride2331 "say The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in"
alias pride2332 "say form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to"
alias pride2333 "say the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to"
alias pride2334 "say himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the"
alias pride2335 "say observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet,"
alias pride2336 "say Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the"
alias pride2337 "say mother in these words:"
alias pride2338 "say "May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit"
alias pride2339 "say for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?""
alias pride2340 "say Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered"
alias pride2341 "say instantly, "Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she"
alias pride2342 "say can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And, gathering her work"
alias pride2343 "say together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:"
alias pride2344 "say "Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have"
alias pride2345 "say nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself.""
alias pride2346 "say "No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are." And upon Elizabeth's"
alias pride2347 "say seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: "Lizzy, I"
alias pride2348 "say insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.""
alias pride2349 "say Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment's consideration making"
alias pride2350 "say her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she"
alias pride2351 "say sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were"
alias pride2352 "say divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as"
alias pride2353 "say they were gone, Mr. Collins began."
alias pride2354 "say "Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any"
alias pride2355 "say disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my"
alias pride2356 "say eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have"
alias pride2357 "say your respected mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of"
alias pride2358 "say my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have"
alias pride2359 "say been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as"
alias pride2360 "say the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this"
alias pride2361 "say subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and,"
alias pride2362 "say moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly"
alias pride2363 "say did." "
alias pride2364 "say The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his"
alias pride2365 "say feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed"
alias pride2366 "say in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued:"
alias pride2367 "say "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in"
alias pride2368 "say easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly,"
alias pride2369 "say that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which"
alias pride2370 "say perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and"
alias pride2371 "say recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice"
alias pride2372 "say has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but"
alias pride2373 "say the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs."
alias pride2374 "say Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must"
alias pride2375 "say marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my"
alias pride2376 "say sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but"
alias pride2377 "say able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon"
alias pride2378 "say as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe,"
alias pride2379 "say my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as"
alias pride2380 "say among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond"
alias pride2381 "say anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,"
alias pride2382 "say especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite."
alias pride2383 "say Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my"
alias pride2384 "say views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can"
alias pride2385 "say assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to"
alias pride2386 "say inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many"
alias pride2387 "say years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his"
alias pride2388 "say daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event"
alias pride2389 "say takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has"
alias pride2390 "say been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And"
alias pride2391 "say now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the"
alias pride2392 "say violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand"
alias pride2393 "say of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and"
alias pride2394 "say that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your"
alias pride2395 "say mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be"
alias pride2396 "say uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass"
alias pride2397 "say my lips when we are married.""
alias pride2398 "say It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now."
alias pride2399 "say "You are too hasty, sir," she cried. "You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it"
alias pride2400 "say without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am"
alias pride2401 "say very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise"
alias pride2402 "say than to decline them.""
alias pride2403 "say "I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is"
alias pride2404 "say usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to"
alias pride2405 "say accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a"
alias pride2406 "say second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just"
alias pride2407 "say said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long." "
alias pride2408 "say "Upon my word, sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my"
alias pride2409 "say declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies"
alias pride2410 "say there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second"
alias pride2411 "say time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am"
alias pride2412 "say convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your"
alias pride2413 "say friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill"
alias pride2414 "say qualified for the situation.""
alias pride2415 "say "Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins very gravely—"
alias pride2416 "say "but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be"
alias pride2417 "say certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of"
alias pride2418 "say your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.""
alias pride2419 "say "Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to"
alias pride2420 "say judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very"
alias pride2421 "say happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being"
alias pride2422 "say otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings"
alias pride2423 "say with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls,"
alias pride2424 "say without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And"
alias pride2425 "say rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus"
alias pride2426 "say addressed her:"
alias pride2427 "say "When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to"
alias pride2428 "say receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from"
alias pride2429 "say accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your"
alias pride2430 "say sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to"
alias pride2431 "say encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.""
alias pride2432 "say "Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly. If"
alias pride2433 "say what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how"
alias pride2434 "say to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.""
alias pride2435 "say "You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my"
alias pride2436 "say addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does"
alias pride2437 "say not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can"
alias pride2438 "say offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with"
alias pride2439 "say the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my"
alias pride2440 "say favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold"
alias pride2441 "say attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you."
alias pride2442 "say Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your"
alias pride2443 "say loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious"
alias pride2444 "say in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by"
alias pride2445 "say suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.""
alias pride2446 "say "I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which"
alias pride2447 "say consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being"
alias pride2448 "say believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your"
alias pride2449 "say proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid "
alias pride2450 "say it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague"
alias pride2451 "say you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.""
alias pride2452 "say "You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am"
alias pride2453 "say persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my"
alias pride2454 "say proposals will not fail of being acceptable.""
alias pride2455 "say To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and"
alias pride2456 "say immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her"
alias pride2457 "say repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might"
alias pride2458 "say be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be"
alias pride2459 "say mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female."
alias pride2460 "say Chapter 20"
alias pride2461 "say Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs."
alias pride2462 "say Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no"
alias pride2463 "say sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than"
alias pride2464 "say she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on"
alias pride2465 "say the happy prospect or their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these"
alias pride2466 "say felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their"
alias pride2467 "say interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the"
alias pride2468 "say refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful"
alias pride2469 "say modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character."
alias pride2470 "say This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally"
alias pride2471 "say satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals,"
alias pride2472 "say but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so."
alias pride2473 "say "But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I"
alias pride2474 "say will speak to her about it directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know"
alias pride2475 "say her own interest but I will make her know it.""
alias pride2476 "say "Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she is really"
alias pride2477 "say headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to"
alias pride2478 "say a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore"
alias pride2479 "say she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into"
alias pride2480 "say accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to"
alias pride2481 "say my felicity.""
alias pride2482 "say "Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. "Lizzy is only headstrong"
alias pride2483 "say in such matters as these. In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will"
alias pride2484 "say go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure." "
alias pride2485 "say She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as"
alias pride2486 "say she entered the library, "Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an"
alias pride2487 "say uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have"
alias pride2488 "say him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her.""
alias pride2489 "say Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with"
alias pride2490 "say a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication."
alias pride2491 "say "I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her"
alias pride2492 "say speech. "Of what are you talking?""
alias pride2493 "say "Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins"
alias pride2494 "say begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.""
alias pride2495 "say "And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.""
alias pride2496 "say "Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.""
alias pride2497 "say "Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.""
alias pride2498 "say Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library."
alias pride2499 "say "Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have sent for you on an affair of"
alias pride2500 "say importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?""
alias pride2501 "say Elizabeth replied that it was. "Very well—and this offer of marriage you have refused?""
alias pride2502 "say "I have, sir.""
alias pride2503 "say "Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it"
alias pride2504 "say not so, Mrs. Bennet?""
alias pride2505 "say "Yes, or I will never see her again.""
alias pride2506 "say "An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to"
alias pride2507 "say one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins,"
alias pride2508 "say and I will never see you again if you do.""
alias pride2509 "say Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet,"
alias pride2510 "say who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was"
alias pride2511 "say excessively disappointed."
alias pride2512 "say "What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to insist upon"
alias pride2513 "say her marrying him.""
alias pride2514 "say "My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request. First, that you will"
alias pride2515 "say allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my"
alias pride2516 "say room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.""
alias pride2517 "say Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up"
alias pride2518 "say the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She"
alias pride2519 "say endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined"
alias pride2520 "say interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful "
alias pride2521 "say gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never"
alias pride2522 "say did."
alias pride2523 "say Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too"
alias pride2524 "say well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his"
alias pride2525 "say pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the"
alias pride2526 "say possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret."
alias pride2527 "say While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with"
alias pride2528 "say them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I"
alias pride2529 "say am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened this"
alias pride2530 "say morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.""
alias pride2531 "say Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell"
alias pride2532 "say the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was"
alias pride2533 "say alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion,"
alias pride2534 "say and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family."
alias pride2535 "say "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side,"
alias pride2536 "say nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.""
alias pride2537 "say Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth."
alias pride2538 "say "Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and"
alias pride2539 "say caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way. But I"
alias pride2540 "say tell you, Miss Lizzy—if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage"
alias pride2541 "say in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to"
alias pride2542 "say maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you. I"
alias pride2543 "say have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should"
alias pride2544 "say never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in"
alias pride2545 "say talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody."
alias pride2546 "say People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking."
alias pride2547 "say Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never"
alias pride2548 "say pitied.""
alias pride2549 "say Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with"
alias pride2550 "say her or soothe her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without"
alias pride2551 "say interruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room"
alias pride2552 "say with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "Now, I"
alias pride2553 "say do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a"
alias pride2554 "say little conversation together.""
alias pride2555 "say Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her"
alias pride2556 "say ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr."
alias pride2557 "say Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a"
alias pride2558 "say little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a"
alias pride2559 "say doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: "Oh! Mr. Collins!""
alias pride2560 "say "My dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me,""
alias pride2561 "say he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of "
alias pride2562 "say your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a"
alias pride2563 "say young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am"
alias pride2564 "say resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair"
alias pride2565 "say cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so"
alias pride2566 "say perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation."
alias pride2567 "say You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear"
alias pride2568 "say madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid"
alias pride2569 "say yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my"
alias pride2570 "say behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from"
alias pride2571 "say your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly"
alias pride2572 "say meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion"
alias pride2573 "say for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner"
alias pride2574 "say has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.""
alias pride2575 "say Chapter 21"
alias pride2576 "say The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to"
alias pride2577 "say suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some"
alias pride2578 "say peevish allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly"
alias pride2579 "say expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of"
alias pride2580 "say manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions"
alias pride2581 "say which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss"
alias pride2582 "say Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially"
alias pride2583 "say to her friend."
alias pride2584 "say The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill health. Mr. Collins"
alias pride2585 "say was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might"
alias pride2586 "say shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to"
alias pride2587 "say have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay."
alias pride2588 "say After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned,"
alias pride2589 "say and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering"
alias pride2590 "say the town, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of"
alias pride2591 "say everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that"
alias pride2592 "say the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed."
alias pride2593 "say "I found," said he, "as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be"
alias pride2594 "say in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than"
alias pride2595 "say I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.""
alias pride2596 "say She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and"
alias pride2597 "say for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and"
alias pride2598 "say another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly"
alias pride2599 "say attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the "
alias pride2600 "say compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing"
alias pride2601 "say him to her father and mother."
alias pride2602 "say Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield."
alias pride2603 "say The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a"
alias pride2604 "say lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it,"
alias pride2605 "say and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon,"
alias pride2606 "say and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general"
alias pride2607 "say conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even"
alias pride2608 "say from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from"
alias pride2609 "say Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking"
alias pride2610 "say out the letter, said:"
alias pride2611 "say "This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole"
alias pride2612 "say party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town—and without any"
alias pride2613 "say intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.""
alias pride2614 "say She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having"
alias pride2615 "say just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in"
alias pride2616 "say Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: "I do not"
alias pride2617 "say pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest"
alias pride2618 "say friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful"
alias pride2619 "say intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a"
alias pride2620 "say very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these"
alias pride2621 "say highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though"
alias pride2622 "say the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was"
alias pride2623 "say not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being"
alias pride2624 "say there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it,"
alias pride2625 "say in the enjoyment of his."
alias pride2626 "say "It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your"
alias pride2627 "say friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future"
alias pride2628 "say happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and"
alias pride2629 "say that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater"
alias pride2630 "say satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.""
alias pride2631 "say "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter."
alias pride2632 "say I will read it to you:""
alias pride2633 "say "When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to"
alias pride2634 "say London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and"
alias pride2635 "say at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it"
alias pride2636 "say again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his"
alias pride2637 "say vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the"
alias pride2638 "say winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one"
alias pride2639 "say of the crowd—but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may"
alias pride2640 "say abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so"
alias pride2641 "say numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you." "
alias pride2642 "say "It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter.""
alias pride2643 "say "It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he should.""
alias pride2644 "say "Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not"
alias pride2645 "say know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves"
alias pride2646 "say from you.""
alias pride2647 "say "Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we are scarcely less"
alias pride2648 "say eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty,"
alias pride2649 "say elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is"
alias pride2650 "say heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her"
alias pride2651 "say being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my"
alias pride2652 "say feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust"
alias pride2653 "say you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will"
alias pride2654 "say have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all"
alias pride2655 "say wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I"
alias pride2656 "say think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these"
alias pride2657 "say circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest"
alias pride2658 "say Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?""
alias pride2659 "say "What do you think of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?" said Jane as she finished it. "Is it"
alias pride2660 "say not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me"
alias pride2661 "say to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she"
alias pride2662 "say suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my"
alias pride2663 "say guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?""
alias pride2664 "say "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?""
alias pride2665 "say "Most willingly.""
alias pride2666 "say "You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you,"
alias pride2667 "say and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there,"
alias pride2668 "say and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.""
alias pride2669 "say Jane shook her head."
alias pride2670 "say "Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you together can"
alias pride2671 "say doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she"
alias pride2672 "say have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding"
alias pride2673 "say clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is"
alias pride2674 "say the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has"
alias pride2675 "say been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is"
alias pride2676 "say certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the"
alias pride2677 "say way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells"
alias pride2678 "say you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of"
alias pride2679 "say your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to"
alias pride2680 "say persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her"
alias pride2681 "say friend." "
alias pride2682 "say "If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this might"
alias pride2683 "say make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully"
alias pride2684 "say deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.""
alias pride2685 "say "That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take"
alias pride2686 "say comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty"
alias pride2687 "say by her, and must fret no longer.""
alias pride2688 "say "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose"
alias pride2689 "say sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?""
alias pride2690 "say "You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth; "and if, upon mature deliberation, you"
alias pride2691 "say find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of"
alias pride2692 "say being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.""
alias pride2693 "say "How can you talk so?" said Jane, faintly smiling. "You must know that though I should"
alias pride2694 "say be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.""
alias pride2695 "say "I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with"
alias pride2696 "say much compassion.""
alias pride2697 "say "But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand"
alias pride2698 "say things may arise in six months!""
alias pride2699 "say The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared"
alias pride2700 "say to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment"
alias pride2701 "say suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man"
alias pride2702 "say so totally independent of everyone."
alias pride2703 "say She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had"
alias pride2704 "say soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was"
alias pride2705 "say gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that"
alias pride2706 "say Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart."
alias pride2707 "say They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without"
alias pride2708 "say being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication"
alias pride2709 "say gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies"
alias pride2710 "say should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting"
alias pride2711 "say it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down"
alias pride2712 "say again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable"
alias pride2713 "say declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to"
alias pride2714 "say have two full courses."
alias pride2715 "say Chapter 22 "
alias pride2716 "say The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day"
alias pride2717 "say was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of"
alias pride2718 "say thanking her. "It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I"
alias pride2719 "say can express." Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it"
alias pride2720 "say amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte's"
alias pride2721 "say kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else"
alias pride2722 "say than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards"
alias pride2723 "say herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when"
alias pride2724 "say they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave"
alias pride2725 "say Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his"
alias pride2726 "say character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable"
alias pride2727 "say slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid"
alias pride2728 "say the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail"
alias pride2729 "say to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success"
alias pride2730 "say might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte"
alias pride2731 "say had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of"
alias pride2732 "say Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived"
alias pride2733 "say him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet"
alias pride2734 "say him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and"
alias pride2735 "say eloquence awaited her there."
alias pride2736 "say In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, everything was settled"
alias pride2737 "say between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly"
alias pride2738 "say entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a"
alias pride2739 "say solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his"
alias pride2740 "say happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship"
alias pride2741 "say from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who"
alias pride2742 "say accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not"
alias pride2743 "say how soon that establishment were gained."
alias pride2744 "say Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was"
alias pride2745 "say bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most"
alias pride2746 "say eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects"
alias pride2747 "say of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more"
alias pride2748 "say interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was"
alias pride2749 "say likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins"
alias pride2750 "say should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he"
alias pride2751 "say and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were"
alias pride2752 "say properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year"
alias pride2753 "say or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their"
alias pride2754 "say apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed."
alias pride2755 "say She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general"
alias pride2756 "say satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was"
alias pride2757 "say irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband."
alias pride2758 "say Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object;"
alias pride2759 "say it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however"
alias pride2760 "say uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This "
alias pride2761 "say preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever"
alias pride2762 "say been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the"
alias pride2763 "say business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued"
alias pride2764 "say beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her;"
alias pride2765 "say and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a"
alias pride2766 "say disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr."
alias pride2767 "say Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed"
alias pride2768 "say before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it"
alias pride2769 "say could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth"
alias pride2770 "say in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was"
alias pride2771 "say at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous"
alias pride2772 "say love."
alias pride2773 "say As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the"
alias pride2774 "say ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs."
alias pride2775 "say Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at"
alias pride2776 "say Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them."
alias pride2777 "say "My dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what"
alias pride2778 "say I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as"
alias pride2779 "say soon as possible.""
alias pride2780 "say They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a"
alias pride2781 "say return, immediately said:"
alias pride2782 "say "But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? You had"
alias pride2783 "say better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness.""
alias pride2784 "say "My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly"
alias pride2785 "say caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's"
alias pride2786 "say concurrence.""
alias pride2787 "say "You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure;"
alias pride2788 "say and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think"
alias pride2789 "say exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.""
alias pride2790 "say "Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention;"
alias pride2791 "say and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for"
alias pride2792 "say every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,"
alias pride2793 "say though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the"
alias pride2794 "say liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.""
alias pride2795 "say With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he"
alias pride2796 "say meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying"
alias pride2797 "say his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept"
alias pride2798 "say him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his"
alias pride2799 "say reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought"
alias pride2800 "say that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might"
alias pride2801 "say become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind "
alias pride2802 "say was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with"
alias pride2803 "say Elizabeth related the event of the day before."
alias pride2804 "say The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once"
alias pride2805 "say occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him"
alias pride2806 "say seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her"
alias pride2807 "say astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and"
alias pride2808 "say she could not help crying out:"
alias pride2809 "say "Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!""
alias pride2810 "say The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way"
alias pride2811 "say to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more"
alias pride2812 "say than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:"
alias pride2813 "say "Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins"
alias pride2814 "say should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to"
alias pride2815 "say succeed with you?""
alias pride2816 "say But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to"
alias pride2817 "say assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to"
alias pride2818 "say her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness."
alias pride2819 "say "I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte. "You must be surprised, very much"
alias pride2820 "say surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time"
alias pride2821 "say to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you"
alias pride2822 "say know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character,"
alias pride2823 "say connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as"
alias pride2824 "say fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.""
alias pride2825 "say Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" and after an awkward pause, they returned to"
alias pride2826 "say the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to"
alias pride2827 "say reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the"
alias pride2828 "say idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of"
alias pride2829 "say marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had"
alias pride2830 "say always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had"
alias pride2831 "say not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every"
alias pride2832 "say better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most"
alias pride2833 "say humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem,"
alias pride2834 "say was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably"
alias pride2835 "say happy in the lot she had chosen."
alias pride2836 "say Chapter 23 "
alias pride2837 "say Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and"
alias pride2838 "say doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself"
alias pride2839 "say appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many"
alias pride2840 "say compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between"
alias pride2841 "say the houses, he unfolded the matter—to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous;"
alias pride2842 "say for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely"
alias pride2843 "say mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:"
alias pride2844 "say "Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that Mr."
alias pride2845 "say Collins wants to marry Lizzy?""
alias pride2846 "say Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such"
alias pride2847 "say treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged"
alias pride2848 "say leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence"
alias pride2849 "say with the most forbearing courtesy."
alias pride2850 "say Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now"
alias pride2851 "say put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from"
alias pride2852 "say Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and"
alias pride2853 "say sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily"
alias pride2854 "say joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected"
alias pride2855 "say from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of"
alias pride2856 "say Hunsford from London."
alias pride2857 "say Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William"
alias pride2858 "say remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first"
alias pride2859 "say place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that"
alias pride2860 "say Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together;"
alias pride2861 "say and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly"
alias pride2862 "say deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the"
alias pride2863 "say other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points"
alias pride2864 "say she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could"
alias pride2865 "say appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see"
alias pride2866 "say Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William"
alias pride2867 "say or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all"
alias pride2868 "say forgive their daughter."
alias pride2869 "say Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did"
alias pride2870 "say experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to"
alias pride2871 "say discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as"
alias pride2872 "say foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!"
alias pride2873 "say Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment"
alias pride2874 "say than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it"
alias pride2875 "say as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only"
alias pride2876 "say a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at"
alias pride2877 "say Meryton. "
alias pride2878 "say Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the"
alias pride2879 "say comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than"
alias pride2880 "say usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks"
alias pride2881 "say might have been enough to drive happiness away."
alias pride2882 "say Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on"
alias pride2883 "say the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between"
alias pride2884 "say them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister,"
alias pride2885 "say of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for"
alias pride2886 "say whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and"
alias pride2887 "say nothing more was heard of his return."
alias pride2888 "say Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she"
alias pride2889 "say might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived"
alias pride2890 "say on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which"
alias pride2891 "say a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience"
alias pride2892 "say on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his"
alias pride2893 "say happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then"
alias pride2894 "say explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready"
alias pride2895 "say to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able"
alias pride2896 "say to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his"
alias pride2897 "say marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an"
alias pride2898 "say unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the"
alias pride2899 "say happiest of men."
alias pride2900 "say Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet."
alias pride2901 "say On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very"
alias pride2902 "say strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very"
alias pride2903 "say inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her"
alias pride2904 "say health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were"
alias pride2905 "say the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr."
alias pride2906 "say Bingley's continued absence."
alias pride2907 "say Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away"
alias pride2908 "say without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in"
alias pride2909 "say Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly"
alias pride2910 "say incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous"
alias pride2911 "say falsehood."
alias pride2912 "say Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that his sisters"
alias pride2913 "say would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so"
alias pride2914 "say destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could"
alias pride2915 "say not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of"
alias pride2916 "say his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of"
alias pride2917 "say London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment."
alias pride2918 "say As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than"
alias pride2919 "say Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and"
alias pride2920 "say Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her "
alias pride2921 "say mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience"
alias pride2922 "say for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think"
alias pride2923 "say herself very ill used. It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable"
alias pride2924 "say tranquillity."
alias pride2925 "say Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at"
alias pride2926 "say Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too"
alias pride2927 "say happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of lovemaking"
alias pride2928 "say relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent"
alias pride2929 "say by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an"
alias pride2930 "say apology for his absence before the family went to bed."
alias pride2931 "say Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning"
alias pride2932 "say the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of"
alias pride2933 "say hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that"
alias pride2934 "say house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she"
alias pride2935 "say concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low"
alias pride2936 "say voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and"
alias pride2937 "say resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were"
alias pride2938 "say dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband."
alias pride2939 "say "Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever"
alias pride2940 "say be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her"
alias pride2941 "say take her place in it!""
alias pride2942 "say "My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us"
alias pride2943 "say flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.""
alias pride2944 "say This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any"
alias pride2945 "say answer, she went on as before."
alias pride2946 "say "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I"
alias pride2947 "say should not mind it.""
alias pride2948 "say "What should not you mind?""
alias pride2949 "say "I should not mind anything at all.""
alias pride2950 "say "Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.""
alias pride2951 "say "I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could"
alias pride2952 "say have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters, I cannot understand;"
alias pride2953 "say and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should he have it more than anybody else?""
alias pride2954 "say "I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet. "
alias pride2955 "say Chapter 24"
alias pride2956 "say Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed"
alias pride2957 "say the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her"
alias pride2958 "say brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire"
alias pride2959 "say before he left the country."
alias pride2960 "say Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she"
alias pride2961 "say found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort."
alias pride2962 "say Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and"
alias pride2963 "say Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the"
alias pride2964 "say accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also"
alias pride2965 "say with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned"
alias pride2966 "say with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture."
alias pride2967 "say Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent"
alias pride2968 "say indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against"
alias pride2969 "say all others. To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no"
alias pride2970 "say credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and"
alias pride2971 "say much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger,"
alias pride2972 "say hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which"
alias pride2973 "say now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own"
alias pride2974 "say happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only"
alias pride2975 "say sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best,"
alias pride2976 "say but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a"
alias pride2977 "say subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She"
alias pride2978 "say could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were"
alias pride2979 "say suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or"
alias pride2980 "say whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him"
alias pride2981 "say must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her"
alias pride2982 "say peace equally wounded."
alias pride2983 "say A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at"
alias pride2984 "say last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about"
alias pride2985 "say Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying:"
alias pride2986 "say "Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no idea of the"
alias pride2987 "say pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last"
alias pride2988 "say long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.""
alias pride2989 "say Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing."
alias pride2990 "say "You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed, you have no reason. He may live"
alias pride2991 "say in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing"
alias pride2992 "say either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A"
alias pride2993 "say little time, therefore—I shall certainly try to get the better." "
alias pride2994 "say With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not"
alias pride2995 "say been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but"
alias pride2996 "say myself.""
alias pride2997 "say "My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good. Your sweetness and"
alias pride2998 "say disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never"
alias pride2999 "say done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.""
alias pride3000 "say Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her"
alias pride3001 "say sister's warm affection."
alias pride3002 "say "Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and"
alias pride3003 "say are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself"
alias pride3004 "say against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your"
alias pride3005 "say privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love,"
alias pride3006 "say and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied"
alias pride3007 "say with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and"
alias pride3008 "say of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met"
alias pride3009 "say with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage. It is"
alias pride3010 "say unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!""
alias pride3011 "say "My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness."
alias pride3012 "say You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr."
alias pride3013 "say Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one"
alias pride3014 "say of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for"
alias pride3015 "say everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.""
alias pride3016 "say "To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited"
alias pride3017 "say by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should"
alias pride3018 "say only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins"
alias pride3019 "say is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and"
alias pride3020 "say you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way"
alias pride3021 "say of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the"
alias pride3022 "say sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to"
alias pride3023 "say persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security"
alias pride3024 "say for happiness.""
alias pride3025 "say "I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane; "and I hope"
alias pride3026 "say you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded"
alias pride3027 "say to something else. You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat"
alias pride3028 "say you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion"
alias pride3029 "say of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must"
alias pride3030 "say not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often"
alias pride3031 "say nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it"
alias pride3032 "say does.""
alias pride3033 "say "And men take care that they should." "
alias pride3034 "say "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so"
alias pride3035 "say much design in the world as some persons imagine.""
alias pride3036 "say "I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth;"
alias pride3037 "say "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and"
alias pride3038 "say there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want"
alias pride3039 "say of resolution, will do the business.""
alias pride3040 "say "And do you impute it to either of those?""
alias pride3041 "say "Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons"
alias pride3042 "say you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.""
alias pride3043 "say "You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?""
alias pride3044 "say "Yes, in conjunction with his friend.""
alias pride3045 "say "I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his"
alias pride3046 "say happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.""
alias pride3047 "say "Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may"
alias pride3048 "say wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all"
alias pride3049 "say the importance of money, great connections, and pride.""
alias pride3050 "say "Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be"
alias pride3051 "say from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they"
alias pride3052 "say have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes,"
alias pride3053 "say it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think herself"
alias pride3054 "say at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him"
alias pride3055 "say attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By"
alias pride3056 "say supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me"
alias pride3057 "say most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken—"
alias pride3058 "say or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him"
alias pride3059 "say or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.""
alias pride3060 "say Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was"
alias pride3061 "say scarcely ever mentioned between them."
alias pride3062 "say Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a"
alias pride3063 "say day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance"
alias pride3064 "say of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of"
alias pride3065 "say what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a"
alias pride3066 "say common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the"
alias pride3067 "say probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every"
alias pride3068 "say day. Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer."
alias pride3069 "say Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is"
alias pride3070 "say crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a"
alias pride3071 "say little in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction"
alias pride3072 "say among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long "
alias pride3073 "say outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all"
alias pride3074 "say the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and"
alias pride3075 "say would jilt you creditably.""
alias pride3076 "say "Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's"
alias pride3077 "say good fortune.""
alias pride3078 "say "True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may"
alias pride3079 "say befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it.""
alias pride3080 "say Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late"
alias pride3081 "say perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him often,"
alias pride3082 "say and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of"
alias pride3083 "say what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered"
alias pride3084 "say from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was"
alias pride3085 "say pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known"
alias pride3086 "say anything of the matter."
alias pride3087 "say Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating"
alias pride3088 "say circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady"
alias pride3089 "say candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but by"
alias pride3090 "say everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men."
alias pride3091 "say Chapter 25"
alias pride3092 "say After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called"
alias pride3093 "say from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however,"
alias pride3094 "say might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had"
alias pride3095 "say reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that"
alias pride3096 "say was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as"
alias pride3097 "say much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised"
alias pride3098 "say their father another letter of thanks."
alias pride3099 "say On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his"
alias pride3100 "say wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,"
alias pride3101 "say gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The"
alias pride3102 "say Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and"
alias pride3103 "say within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs."
alias pride3104 "say Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an"
alias pride3105 "say amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces."
alias pride3106 "say Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had"
alias pride3107 "say frequently been staying with her in town. "
alias pride3108 "say The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and"
alias pride3109 "say describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It"
alias pride3110 "say became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain"
alias pride3111 "say of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been"
alias pride3112 "say upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it."
alias pride3113 "say "I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could."
alias pride3114 "say But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by"
alias pride3115 "say this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,"
alias pride3116 "say and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married"
alias pride3117 "say before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases"
alias pride3118 "say are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it"
alias pride3119 "say of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own"
alias pride3120 "say family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However,"
alias pride3121 "say your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what"
alias pride3122 "say you tell us, of long sleeves.""
alias pride3123 "say Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of"
alias pride3124 "say Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in"
alias pride3125 "say compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation."
alias pride3126 "say When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. "It seems likely to"
alias pride3127 "say have been a desirable match for Jane," said she. "I am sorry it went off. But these things"
alias pride3128 "say happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love"
alias pride3129 "say with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her,"
alias pride3130 "say that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.""
alias pride3131 "say "An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for us. We do not"
alias pride3132 "say suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a"
alias pride3133 "say young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love"
alias pride3134 "say with only a few days before.""
alias pride3135 "say "But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that"
alias pride3136 "say it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's"
alias pride3137 "say acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley's love?""
alias pride3138 "say "I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other"
alias pride3139 "say people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and"
alias pride3140 "say remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to"
alias pride3141 "say dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer"
alias pride3142 "say symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?""
alias pride3143 "say "Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry"
alias pride3144 "say for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better"
alias pride3145 "say have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you"
alias pride3146 "say think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of"
alias pride3147 "say service—and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything." "
alias pride3148 "say Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's"
alias pride3149 "say ready acquiescence."
alias pride3150 "say "I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will"
alias pride3151 "say influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different,"
alias pride3152 "say and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet"
alias pride3153 "say at all, unless he really comes to see her.""
alias pride3154 "say "And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy"
alias pride3155 "say would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how"
alias pride3156 "say could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch"
alias pride3157 "say Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its"
alias pride3158 "say impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without"
alias pride3159 "say him.""
alias pride3160 "say "So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with"
alias pride3161 "say his sister? She will not be able to help calling.""
alias pride3162 "say "She will drop the acquaintance entirely.""
alias pride3163 "say But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the"
alias pride3164 "say still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude"
alias pride3165 "say on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely"
alias pride3166 "say hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be"
alias pride3167 "say reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural"
alias pride3168 "say influence of Jane's attractions."
alias pride3169 "say Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no"
alias pride3170 "say otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline's not living in the"
alias pride3171 "say same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any"
alias pride3172 "say danger of seeing him."
alias pride3173 "say The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases,"
alias pride3174 "say and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully"
alias pride3175 "say provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a"
alias pride3176 "say family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part"
alias pride3177 "say of it—of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs."
alias pride3178 "say Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation, narrowly observed them"
alias pride3179 "say both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their"
alias pride3180 "say preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to"
alias pride3181 "say speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the"
alias pride3182 "say imprudence of encouraging such an attachment."
alias pride3183 "say To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his"
alias pride3184 "say general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a"
alias pride3185 "say considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore,"
alias pride3186 "say many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death"
alias pride3187 "say of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former"
alias pride3188 "say friends than she had been in the way of procuring. "
alias pride3189 "say Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly"
alias pride3190 "say well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her"
alias pride3191 "say recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in"
alias pride3192 "say bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both"
alias pride3193 "say him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him,"
alias pride3194 "say she tried to remember some of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which"
alias pride3195 "say might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr."
alias pride3196 "say Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy."
alias pride3197 "say Chapter 26"
alias pride3198 "say Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first"
alias pride3199 "say favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought,"
alias pride3200 "say she thus went on:"
alias pride3201 "say "You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against"
alias pride3202 "say it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on"
alias pride3203 "say your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the"
alias pride3204 "say want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a"
alias pride3205 "say most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you"
alias pride3206 "say could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have"
alias pride3207 "say sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and"
alias pride3208 "say good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.""
alias pride3209 "say "My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.""
alias pride3210 "say "Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.""
alias pride3211 "say "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr."
alias pride3212 "say Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.""
alias pride3213 "say "Elizabeth, you are not serious now.""
alias pride3214 "say "I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I"
alias pride3215 "say certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and"
alias pride3216 "say if he becomes really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the"
alias pride3217 "say imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does me the"
alias pride3218 "say greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr."
alias pride3219 "say Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of"
alias pride3220 "say you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are"
alias pride3221 "say seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each"
alias pride3222 "say other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted,"
alias pride3223 "say or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, "
alias pride3224 "say therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object."
alias pride3225 "say When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.""
alias pride3226 "say "Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you"
alias pride3227 "say should not remind your mother of inviting him.""
alias pride3228 "say "As I did the other day," said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: "very true, it will be wise"
alias pride3229 "say in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your"
alias pride3230 "say account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to"
alias pride3231 "say the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try"
alias pride3232 "say to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.""
alias pride3233 "say Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of"
alias pride3234 "say her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without"
alias pride3235 "say being resented."
alias pride3236 "say Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners"
alias pride3237 "say and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great"
alias pride3238 "say inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at"
alias pride3239 "say length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured"
alias pride3240 "say tone, that she "wished they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on"
alias pride3241 "say Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth,"
alias pride3242 "say ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected"
alias pride3243 "say herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:"
alias pride3244 "say "I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.""
alias pride3245 "say "That you certainly shall.""
alias pride3246 "say "And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?""
alias pride3247 "say "We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.""
alias pride3248 "say "I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to"
alias pride3249 "say Hunsford.""
alias pride3250 "say Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit."
alias pride3251 "say "My father and Maria are coming to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will"
alias pride3252 "say consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.""
alias pride3253 "say The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door,"
alias pride3254 "say and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard"
alias pride3255 "say from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been;"
alias pride3256 "say that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her"
alias pride3257 "say without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to"
alias pride3258 "say slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was."
alias pride3259 "say Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be"
alias pride3260 "say curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady"
alias pride3261 "say Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters"
alias pride3262 "say were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she "
alias pride3263 "say might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and"
alias pride3264 "say mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and"
alias pride3265 "say roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging."
alias pride3266 "say It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth"
alias pride3267 "say perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest."
alias pride3268 "say Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London;"
alias pride3269 "say and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of"
alias pride3270 "say the Bingleys."
alias pride3271 "say Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is."
alias pride3272 "say Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She"
alias pride3273 "say accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn"
alias pride3274 "say had by some accident been lost."
alias pride3275 "say "My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take"
alias pride3276 "say the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.""
alias pride3277 "say She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. "I did not think"
alias pride3278 "say Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me"
alias pride3279 "say for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had"
alias pride3280 "say never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much"
alias pride3281 "say engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was"
alias pride3282 "say expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs."
alias pride3283 "say Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here.""
alias pride3284 "say Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could"
alias pride3285 "say discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town."
alias pride3286 "say Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade"
alias pride3287 "say herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's"
alias pride3288 "say inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every"
alias pride3289 "say evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay,"
alias pride3290 "say and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer."
alias pride3291 "say The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt."
alias pride3292 "say "My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at"
alias pride3293 "say my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard"
alias pride3294 "say for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me"
alias pride3295 "say obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as"
alias pride3296 "say natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate"
alias pride3297 "say with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be"
alias pride3298 "say deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did"
alias pride3299 "say I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure"
alias pride3300 "say in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to"
alias pride3301 "say see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was"
alias pride3302 "say perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help"
alias pride3303 "say blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every"
alias pride3304 "say advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has "
alias pride3305 "say been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it."
alias pride3306 "say I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet"
alias pride3307 "say if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is"
alias pride3308 "say to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot"
alias pride3309 "say but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about"
alias pride3310 "say me, we must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from"
alias pride3311 "say something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she"
alias pride3312 "say wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I"
alias pride3313 "say were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong"
alias pride3314 "say appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and"
alias pride3315 "say think only of what will make me happy—your affection, and the invariable kindness of my"
alias pride3316 "say dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his"
alias pride3317 "say never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We"
alias pride3318 "say had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from"
alias pride3319 "say our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you"
alias pride3320 "say will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc.""
alias pride3321 "say This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane"
alias pride3322 "say would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now"
alias pride3323 "say absolutely over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk"
alias pride3324 "say on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane,"
alias pride3325 "say she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's"
alias pride3326 "say account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away."
alias pride3327 "say Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that"
alias pride3328 "say gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give"
alias pride3329 "say contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions"
alias pride3330 "say were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all,"
alias pride3331 "say but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly"
alias pride3332 "say touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only"
alias pride3333 "say choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the"
alias pride3334 "say most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself"
alias pride3335 "say agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte's, did not"
alias pride3336 "say quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more"
alias pride3337 "say natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was"
alias pride3338 "say ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him"
alias pride3339 "say happy."
alias pride3340 "say All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she"
alias pride3341 "say thus went on: "I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for"
alias pride3342 "say had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very"
alias pride3343 "say name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him;"
alias pride3344 "say they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I"
alias pride3345 "say am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all"
alias pride3346 "say this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more"
alias pride3347 "say interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say"
alias pride3348 "say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too"
alias pride3349 "say dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in "
alias pride3350 "say the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young"
alias pride3351 "say men must have something to live on as well as the plain.""
alias pride3352 "say Chapter 27"
alias pride3353 "say With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by"
alias pride3354 "say little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and"
alias pride3355 "say February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought"
alias pride3356 "say very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan"
alias pride3357 "say and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater"
alias pride3358 "say certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her"
alias pride3359 "say disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and"
alias pride3360 "say such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not"
alias pride3361 "say unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in"
alias pride3362 "say short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything,"
alias pride3363 "say however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch."
alias pride3364 "say She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending"
alias pride3365 "say a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be."
alias pride3366 "say The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it"
alias pride3367 "say came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost"
alias pride3368 "say promised to answer her letter."
alias pride3369 "say The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even"
alias pride3370 "say more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to"
alias pride3371 "say excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and"
alias pride3372 "say in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she"
alias pride3373 "say was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her—their opinion"
alias pride3374 "say of everybody—would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt"
alias pride3375 "say must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced"
alias pride3376 "say that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing."
alias pride3377 "say Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less"
alias pride3378 "say agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as emptyheaded"
alias pride3379 "say as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with"
alias pride3380 "say about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had"
alias pride3381 "say known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his"
alias pride3382 "say presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information."
alias pride3383 "say It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in"
alias pride3384 "say Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawingroom"
alias pride3385 "say window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to"
alias pride3386 "say welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful"
alias pride3387 "say and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for "
alias pride3388 "say their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose"
alias pride3389 "say shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was"
alias pride3390 "say joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and"
alias pride3391 "say shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres."
alias pride3392 "say Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her sister; and she was"
alias pride3393 "say more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane"
alias pride3394 "say always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable,"
alias pride3395 "say however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars"
alias pride3396 "say also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at"
alias pride3397 "say different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart,"
alias pride3398 "say given up the acquaintance."
alias pride3399 "say Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on"
alias pride3400 "say bearing it so well."
alias pride3401 "say "But my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to"
alias pride3402 "say think our friend mercenary.""
alias pride3403 "say "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary"
alias pride3404 "say and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you"
alias pride3405 "say were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is"
alias pride3406 "say trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is"
alias pride3407 "say mercenary.""
alias pride3408 "say "If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.""
alias pride3409 "say "She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.""
alias pride3410 "say "But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death made her mistress"
alias pride3411 "say of this fortune.""
alias pride3412 "say "No—why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because I"
alias pride3413 "say had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care"
alias pride3414 "say about, and who was equally poor?""
alias pride3415 "say "But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this"
alias pride3416 "say event.""
alias pride3417 "say "A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which"
alias pride3418 "say other people may observe. If she does not object to it, why should we?""
alias pride3419 "say "Her not objecting does not justify him. It only shows her being deficient in something"
alias pride3420 "say herself—sense or feeling.""
alias pride3421 "say "Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be"
alias pride3422 "say foolish.""
alias pride3423 "say "No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a"
alias pride3424 "say young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire." "
alias pride3425 "say "Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and"
alias pride3426 "say their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all."
alias pride3427 "say Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable"
alias pride3428 "say quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones"
alias pride3429 "say worth knowing, after all.""
alias pride3430 "say "Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.""
alias pride3431 "say Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected"
alias pride3432 "say happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they"
alias pride3433 "say proposed taking in the summer."
alias pride3434 "say "We have not determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs. Gardiner, "but, perhaps, to"
alias pride3435 "say the Lakes.""
alias pride3436 "say No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the"
alias pride3437 "say invitation was most ready and grateful. "Oh, my dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried,"
alias pride3438 "say "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment"
alias pride3439 "say and spleen. What are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we"
alias pride3440 "say shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able"
alias pride3441 "say to give one accurate idea of anything. We will know where we have gone—we will recollect"
alias pride3442 "say what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our"
alias pride3443 "say imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin"
alias pride3444 "say quarreling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those"
alias pride3445 "say of the generality of travellers.""
alias pride3446 "say Chapter 28"
alias pride3447 "say Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her"
alias pride3448 "say spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish"
alias pride3449 "say all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight."
alias pride3450 "say When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the"
alias pride3451 "say Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was"
alias pride3452 "say their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of"
alias pride3453 "say its inhabitants."
alias pride3454 "say At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house"
alias pride3455 "say standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving."
alias pride3456 "say Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate"
alias pride3457 "say which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole"
alias pride3458 "say party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs."
alias pride3459 "say Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more"
alias pride3460 "say satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly "
alias pride3461 "say that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what"
alias pride3462 "say it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries"
alias pride3463 "say after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness"
alias pride3464 "say of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed"
alias pride3465 "say them a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually"
alias pride3466 "say repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment."
alias pride3467 "say Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in"
alias pride3468 "say displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed"
alias pride3469 "say himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him."
alias pride3470 "say But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any"
alias pride3471 "say sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so"
alias pride3472 "say cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife"
alias pride3473 "say might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned"
alias pride3474 "say her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte"
alias pride3475 "say wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the"
alias pride3476 "say room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that"
alias pride3477 "say had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was"
alias pride3478 "say large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this"
alias pride3479 "say garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of"
alias pride3480 "say countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned"
alias pride3481 "say she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross"
alias pride3482 "say walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view"
alias pride3483 "say was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the"
alias pride3484 "say fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant"
alias pride3485 "say clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could boast,"
alias pride3486 "say none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees"
alias pride3487 "say that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern"
alias pride3488 "say building, well situated on rising ground."
alias pride3489 "say From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the"
alias pride3490 "say ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while"
alias pride3491 "say Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house,"
alias pride3492 "say extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her"
alias pride3493 "say husband's help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted"
alias pride3494 "say up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the"
alias pride3495 "say credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort"
alias pride3496 "say throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often"
alias pride3497 "say forgotten."
alias pride3498 "say She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again"
alias pride3499 "say while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed:"
alias pride3500 "say "Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on"
alias pride3501 "say the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all"
alias pride3502 "say affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of"
alias pride3503 "say her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you"
alias pride3504 "say and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. "
alias pride3505 "say Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and"
alias pride3506 "say are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should"
alias pride3507 "say say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.""
alias pride3508 "say "Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a"
alias pride3509 "say most attentive neighbour.""
alias pride3510 "say "Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one"
alias pride3511 "say cannot regard with too much deference.""
alias pride3512 "say The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what"
alias pride3513 "say had already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had"
alias pride3514 "say to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,"
alias pride3515 "say and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very"
alias pride3516 "say well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual"
alias pride3517 "say employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their"
alias pride3518 "say intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all."
alias pride3519 "say About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a"
alias pride3520 "say sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a"
alias pride3521 "say moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after"
alias pride3522 "say her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation,"
alias pride3523 "say cried out—"
alias pride3524 "say "Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a"
alias pride3525 "say sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.""
alias pride3526 "say Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran"
alias pride3527 "say into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies"
alias pride3528 "say stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate."
alias pride3529 "say "And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the"
alias pride3530 "say garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter.""
alias pride3531 "say "La! my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine. The"
alias pride3532 "say old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at"
alias pride3533 "say her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and"
alias pride3534 "say small?""
alias pride3535 "say "She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not"
alias pride3536 "say come in?""
alias pride3537 "say "Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de"
alias pride3538 "say Bourgh comes in.""
alias pride3539 "say "I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She looks sickly and"
alias pride3540 "say cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.""
alias pride3541 "say Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies;"
alias pride3542 "say and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest "
alias pride3543 "say contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de"
alias pride3544 "say Bourgh looked that way."
alias pride3545 "say At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned"
alias pride3546 "say into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them"
alias pride3547 "say on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party"
alias pride3548 "say was asked to dine at Rosings the next day."
alias pride3549 "say Chapter 29"
alias pride3550 "say Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of"
alias pride3551 "say displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see"
alias pride3552 "say her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an"
alias pride3553 "say opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's"
alias pride3554 "say condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough."
alias pride3555 "say "I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking"
alias pride3556 "say us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my"
alias pride3557 "say knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an"
alias pride3558 "say attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine"
alias pride3559 "say there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your"
alias pride3560 "say arrival!""
alias pride3561 "say "I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that"
alias pride3562 "say knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has"
alias pride3563 "say allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not"
alias pride3564 "say uncommon.""
alias pride3565 "say Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings."
alias pride3566 "say Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of"
alias pride3567 "say such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them."
alias pride3568 "say When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth—"
alias pride3569 "say "Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far"
alias pride3570 "say from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would"
alias pride3571 "say advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no"
alias pride3572 "say occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being"
alias pride3573 "say simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.""
alias pride3574 "say While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to"
alias pride3575 "say recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for"
alias pride3576 "say her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite"
alias pride3577 "say frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her "
alias pride3578 "say introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his"
alias pride3579 "say presentation at St. James's."
alias pride3580 "say As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park."
alias pride3581 "say Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with,"
alias pride3582 "say though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and"
alias pride3583 "say was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his"
alias pride3584 "say relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh."
alias pride3585 "say When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing,"
alias pride3586 "say and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She"
alias pride3587 "say had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or"
alias pride3588 "say miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness"
alias pride3589 "say without trepidation."
alias pride3590 "say From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine"
alias pride3591 "say proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber,"
alias pride3592 "say to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her"
alias pride3593 "say ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it"
alias pride3594 "say with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper"
alias pride3595 "say manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary."
alias pride3596 "say In spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so completely awed by the"
alias pride3597 "say grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow,"
alias pride3598 "say and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her"
alias pride3599 "say senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself"
alias pride3600 "say quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady"
alias pride3601 "say Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have"
alias pride3602 "say been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as"
alias pride3603 "say to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence;"
alias pride3604 "say but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance,"
alias pride3605 "say and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the"
alias pride3606 "say day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented."
alias pride3607 "say When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found"
alias pride3608 "say some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have"
alias pride3609 "say joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure"
alias pride3610 "say nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features,"
alias pride3611 "say though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs."
alias pride3612 "say Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely"
alias pride3613 "say engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her"
alias pride3614 "say eyes."
alias pride3615 "say After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view,"
alias pride3616 "say Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing"
alias pride3617 "say them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer."
alias pride3618 "say The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles"
alias pride3619 "say of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat "
alias pride3620 "say at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could"
alias pride3621 "say furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every"
alias pride3622 "say dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough"
alias pride3623 "say recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered"
alias pride3624 "say Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive"
alias pride3625 "say admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a"
alias pride3626 "say novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak"
alias pride3627 "say whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de"
alias pride3628 "say Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter"
alias pride3629 "say said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching"
alias pride3630 "say how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was"
alias pride3631 "say indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but"
alias pride3632 "say eat and admire."
alias pride3633 "say When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear"
alias pride3634 "say Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering"
alias pride3635 "say her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to"
alias pride3636 "say have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns"
alias pride3637 "say familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all;"
alias pride3638 "say told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed"
alias pride3639 "say her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this"
alias pride3640 "say great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the"
alias pride3641 "say intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria"
alias pride3642 "say and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who"
alias pride3643 "say she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at"
alias pride3644 "say different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself,"
alias pride3645 "say whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they"
alias pride3646 "say had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden"
alias pride3647 "say name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very"
alias pride3648 "say composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,"
alias pride3649 "say "Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake," turning to"
alias pride3650 "say Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the"
alias pride3651 "say female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and"
alias pride3652 "say sing, Miss Bennet?""
alias pride3653 "say "A little.""
alias pride3654 "say "Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital"
alias pride3655 "say one, probably superior to——You shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?""
alias pride3656 "say "One of them does.""
alias pride3657 "say "Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and"
alias pride3658 "say their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you draw?""
alias pride3659 "say "No, not at all.""
alias pride3660 "say "What, none of you?" "
alias pride3661 "say "Not one.""
alias pride3662 "say "That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have"
alias pride3663 "say taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.""
alias pride3664 "say "My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.""
alias pride3665 "say "Has your governess left you?""
alias pride3666 "say "We never had any governess.""
alias pride3667 "say "No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a"
alias pride3668 "say governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your"
alias pride3669 "say education.""
alias pride3670 "say Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case."
alias pride3671 "say "Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been"
alias pride3672 "say neglected.""
alias pride3673 "say "Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn"
alias pride3674 "say never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that"
alias pride3675 "say were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.""
alias pride3676 "say "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your"
alias pride3677 "say mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing"
alias pride3678 "say is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a"
alias pride3679 "say governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of"
alias pride3680 "say supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces"
alias pride3681 "say of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other"
alias pride3682 "say day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to"
alias pride3683 "say me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady"
alias pride3684 "say Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady Catherine,'"
alias pride3685 "say said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?""
alias pride3686 "say "Yes, ma'am, all.""
alias pride3687 "say "All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones"
alias pride3688 "say out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?""
alias pride3689 "say "Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But"
alias pride3690 "say really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have"
alias pride3691 "say their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or"
alias pride3692 "say inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at the"
alias pride3693 "say first. And to be kept back on such a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote"
alias pride3694 "say sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.""
alias pride3695 "say "Upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young"
alias pride3696 "say a person. Pray, what is your age?" "
alias pride3697 "say "With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth, smiling, "your ladyship can"
alias pride3698 "say hardly expect me to own it.""
alias pride3699 "say Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth"
alias pride3700 "say suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified"
alias pride3701 "say impertinence."
alias pride3702 "say "You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.""
alias pride3703 "say "I am not one-and-twenty.""
alias pride3704 "say When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed."
alias pride3705 "say Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss"
alias pride3706 "say de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson"
alias pride3707 "say to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered"
alias pride3708 "say that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de"
alias pride3709 "say Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more"
alias pride3710 "say passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating the mistakes of"
alias pride3711 "say the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing"
alias pride3712 "say to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he"
alias pride3713 "say thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with"
alias pride3714 "say anecdotes and noble names."
alias pride3715 "say When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were"
alias pride3716 "say broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately"
alias pride3717 "say ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what"
alias pride3718 "say weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by"
alias pride3719 "say the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side and"
alias pride3720 "say as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door,"
alias pride3721 "say Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at"
alias pride3722 "say Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her"
alias pride3723 "say commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins,"
alias pride3724 "say and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands."
alias pride3725 "say Chapter 30"
alias pride3726 "say Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince"
alias pride3727 "say him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband"
alias pride3728 "say and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr."
alias pride3729 "say Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but"
alias pride3730 "say when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth"
alias pride3731 "say was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief"
alias pride3732 "say of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the"
alias pride3733 "say garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room, "
alias pride3734 "say which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at"
alias pride3735 "say first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it"
alias pride3736 "say was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend"
alias pride3737 "say had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been"
alias pride3738 "say much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte"
alias pride3739 "say credit for the arrangement."
alias pride3740 "say From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to"
alias pride3741 "say Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss"
alias pride3742 "say de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though"
alias pride3743 "say it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few"
alias pride3744 "say minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out."
alias pride3745 "say Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in"
alias pride3746 "say which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that"
alias pride3747 "say there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice"
alias pride3748 "say of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and"
alias pride3749 "say nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She"
alias pride3750 "say examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it"
alias pride3751 "say differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in"
alias pride3752 "say negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding"
alias pride3753 "say out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family."
alias pride3754 "say Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace"
alias pride3755 "say of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of"
alias pride3756 "say which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed"
alias pride3757 "say to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their"
alias pride3758 "say differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty."
alias pride3759 "say The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing"
alias pride3760 "say for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such"
alias pride3761 "say entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the"
alias pride3762 "say style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,"
alias pride3763 "say however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably"
alias pride3764 "say enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was"
alias pride3765 "say so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite"
alias pride3766 "say walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was"
alias pride3767 "say along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered"
alias pride3768 "say path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of"
alias pride3769 "say Lady Catherine's curiosity."
alias pride3770 "say In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was"
alias pride3771 "say approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings,"
alias pride3772 "say which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that"
alias pride3773 "say Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not"
alias pride3774 "say many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one"
alias pride3775 "say comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing"
alias pride3776 "say how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for "
alias pride3777 "say whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the"
alias pride3778 "say greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost"
alias pride3779 "say angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself."
alias pride3780 "say His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole"
alias pride3781 "say morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest"
alias pride3782 "say assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home"
alias pride3783 "say with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his"
alias pride3784 "say respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had"
alias pride3785 "say brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord ——, and, to the"
alias pride3786 "say great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him."
alias pride3787 "say Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately"
alias pride3788 "say running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:"
alias pride3789 "say "I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so"
alias pride3790 "say soon to wait upon me.""
alias pride3791 "say Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach"
alias pride3792 "say was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the"
alias pride3793 "say room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person"
alias pride3794 "say and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in"
alias pride3795 "say Hertfordshire—paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever"
alias pride3796 "say might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure."
alias pride3797 "say Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word."
alias pride3798 "say Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a"
alias pride3799 "say well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight"
alias pride3800 "say observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to"
alias pride3801 "say anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth"
alias pride3802 "say after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's"
alias pride3803 "say pause, added:"
alias pride3804 "say "My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see"
alias pride3805 "say her there?""
alias pride3806 "say She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would"
alias pride3807 "say betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she"
alias pride3808 "say thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to"
alias pride3809 "say meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards"
alias pride3810 "say went away."
alias pride3811 "say Chapter 31 "
alias pride3812 "say Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies"
alias pride3813 "say all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It"
alias pride3814 "say was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither—for while there were"
alias pride3815 "say visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a"
alias pride3816 "say week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then"
alias pride3817 "say they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week"
alias pride3818 "say they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called"
alias pride3819 "say at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at"
alias pride3820 "say church."
alias pride3821 "say The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady"
alias pride3822 "say Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their"
alias pride3823 "say company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was,"
alias pride3824 "say in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much"
alias pride3825 "say more than to any other person in the room."
alias pride3826 "say Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to"
alias pride3827 "say him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much."
alias pride3828 "say He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of"
alias pride3829 "say travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half"
alias pride3830 "say so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as"
alias pride3831 "say to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been"
alias pride3832 "say soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,"
alias pride3833 "say after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to"
alias pride3834 "say call out:"
alias pride3835 "say "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you"
alias pride3836 "say telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.""
alias pride3837 "say "We are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply."
alias pride3838 "say "Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share"
alias pride3839 "say in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I"
alias pride3840 "say suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I"
alias pride3841 "say had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had"
alias pride3842 "say allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does"
alias pride3843 "say Georgiana get on, Darcy?""
alias pride3844 "say Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency."
alias pride3845 "say "I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell"
alias pride3846 "say her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal.""
alias pride3847 "say "I assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice. She practises"
alias pride3848 "say very constantly.""
alias pride3849 "say "So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall"
alias pride3850 "say charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in"
alias pride3851 "say music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times,"
alias pride3852 "say that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has "
alias pride3853 "say no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day,"
alias pride3854 "say and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you"
alias pride3855 "say know, in that part of the house.""
alias pride3856 "say Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made no answer."
alias pride3857 "say When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to"
alias pride3858 "say play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady"
alias pride3859 "say Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the"
alias pride3860 "say latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte"
alias pride3861 "say stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance."
alias pride3862 "say Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an"
alias pride3863 "say arch smile, and said:"
alias pride3864 "say "You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be"
alias pride3865 "say alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never"
alias pride3866 "say can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to"
alias pride3867 "say intimidate me.""
alias pride3868 "say "I shall not say you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to"
alias pride3869 "say entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long"
alias pride3870 "say enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in"
alias pride3871 "say fact are not your own.""
alias pride3872 "say Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam,"
alias pride3873 "say "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I"
alias pride3874 "say say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character,"
alias pride3875 "say in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit."
alias pride3876 "say Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my"
alias pride3877 "say disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is"
alias pride3878 "say provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to"
alias pride3879 "say hear.""
alias pride3880 "say "I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly."
alias pride3881 "say "Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. "I should"
alias pride3882 "say like to know how he behaves among strangers.""
alias pride3883 "say "You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of"
alias pride3884 "say my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what"
alias pride3885 "say do you think he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to"
alias pride3886 "say my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr."
alias pride3887 "say Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.""
alias pride3888 "say "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own"
alias pride3889 "say party.""
alias pride3890 "say "True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam,"
alias pride3891 "say what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders." "
alias pride3892 "say "Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I"
alias pride3893 "say am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.""
alias pride3894 "say "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel"
alias pride3895 "say Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the"
alias pride3896 "say world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?""
alias pride3897 "say "I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him. It is because he"
alias pride3898 "say will not give himself the trouble.""
alias pride3899 "say "I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing"
alias pride3900 "say easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or"
alias pride3901 "say appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.""
alias pride3902 "say "My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner"
alias pride3903 "say which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not"
alias pride3904 "say produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—"
alias pride3905 "say because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as"
alias pride3906 "say capable as any other woman's of superior execution.""
alias pride3907 "say Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much"
alias pride3908 "say better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We"
alias pride3909 "say neither of us perform to strangers.""
alias pride3910 "say Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were"
alias pride3911 "say talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and,"
alias pride3912 "say after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:"
alias pride3913 "say "Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the"
alias pride3914 "say advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is"
alias pride3915 "say not equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed"
alias pride3916 "say her to learn.""
alias pride3917 "say Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but"
alias pride3918 "say neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from"
alias pride3919 "say the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley,"
alias pride3920 "say that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation."
alias pride3921 "say Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them"
alias pride3922 "say many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance"
alias pride3923 "say of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's"
alias pride3924 "say carriage was ready to take them all home."
alias pride3925 "say Chapter 32 "
alias pride3926 "say Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins"
alias pride3927 "say and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the"
alias pride3928 "say door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely"
alias pride3929 "say to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter"
alias pride3930 "say that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very"
alias pride3931 "say great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room."
alias pride3932 "say He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting"
alias pride3933 "say her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within."
alias pride3934 "say They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger"
alias pride3935 "say of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something,"
alias pride3936 "say and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling"
alias pride3937 "say curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:"
alias pride3938 "say "How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have"
alias pride3939 "say been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I"
alias pride3940 "say recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you"
alias pride3941 "say left London?""
alias pride3942 "say "Perfectly so, I thank you.""
alias pride3943 "say She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added:"
alias pride3944 "say "I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to"
alias pride3945 "say Netherfield again?""
alias pride3946 "say "I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time"
alias pride3947 "say there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and"
alias pride3948 "say engagements are continually increasing.""
alias pride3949 "say "If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that"
alias pride3950 "say he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there."
alias pride3951 "say But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the"
alias pride3952 "say neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same"
alias pride3953 "say principle.""
alias pride3954 "say "I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible"
alias pride3955 "say purchase offers.""
alias pride3956 "say Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having"
alias pride3957 "say nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him."
alias pride3958 "say He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house. Lady"
alias pride3959 "say Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.""
alias pride3960 "say "I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more"
alias pride3961 "say grateful object.""
alias pride3962 "say "Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife." "
alias pride3963 "say "Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few"
alias pride3964 "say sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My"
alias pride3965 "say friend has an excellent understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her marrying"
alias pride3966 "say Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a"
alias pride3967 "say prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.""
alias pride3968 "say "It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own"
alias pride3969 "say family and friends.""
alias pride3970 "say "An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.""
alias pride3971 "say "And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I call it"
alias pride3972 "say a very easy distance.""
alias pride3973 "say "I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match,""
alias pride3974 "say cried Elizabeth. "I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family.""
alias pride3975 "say "It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very"
alias pride3976 "say neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.""
alias pride3977 "say As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be"
alias pride3978 "say supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:"
alias pride3979 "say "I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and"
alias pride3980 "say the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is"
alias pride3981 "say fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that"
alias pride3982 "say is not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as"
alias pride3983 "say will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near"
alias pride3984 "say her family under less than half the present distance.""
alias pride3985 "say Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "You cannot have a right to such"
alias pride3986 "say very strong local attachment. You cannot have been always at Longbourn.""
alias pride3987 "say Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew"
alias pride3988 "say back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:"
alias pride3989 "say "Are you pleased with Kent?""
alias pride3990 "say A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise—"
alias pride3991 "say and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her"
alias pride3992 "say walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned"
alias pride3993 "say his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to"
alias pride3994 "say anybody, went away."
alias pride3995 "say "What can be the meaning of this?" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. "My dear,"
alias pride3996 "say Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way.""
alias pride3997 "say But when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's"
alias pride3998 "say wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit"
alias pride3999 "say to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from"
alias pride4000 "say the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, "
alias pride4001 "say and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the"
alias pride4002 "say Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two"
alias pride4003 "say cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They"
alias pride4004 "say called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now"
alias pride4005 "say and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came"
alias pride4006 "say because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him"
alias pride4007 "say still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as"
alias pride4008 "say by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in"
alias pride4009 "say comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's"
alias pride4010 "say manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind."
alias pride4011 "say But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It"
alias pride4012 "say could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his"
alias pride4013 "say lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a"
alias pride4014 "say sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs."
alias pride4015 "say Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his"
alias pride4016 "say stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could"
alias pride4017 "say not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and"
alias pride4018 "say the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She"
alias pride4019 "say watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but"
alias pride4020 "say without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of"
alias pride4021 "say that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether"
alias pride4022 "say there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind."
alias pride4023 "say She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her,"
alias pride4024 "say but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the"
alias pride4025 "say subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment;"
alias pride4026 "say for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she"
alias pride4027 "say could suppose him to be in her power."
alias pride4028 "say In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel"
alias pride4029 "say Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her,"
alias pride4030 "say and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr."
alias pride4031 "say Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all."
alias pride4032 "say Chapter 33"
alias pride4033 "say More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr."
alias pride4034 "say Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one"
alias pride4035 "say else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first"
alias pride4036 "say that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very"
alias pride4037 "say odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for"
alias pride4038 "say on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then "
alias pride4039 "say away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a"
alias pride4040 "say great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck"
alias pride4041 "say her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected"
alias pride4042 "say questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her"
alias pride4043 "say opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not"
alias pride4044 "say perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent"
alias pride4045 "say again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel"
alias pride4046 "say Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion"
alias pride4047 "say to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find"
alias pride4048 "say herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage."
alias pride4049 "say She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on"
alias pride4050 "say some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being"
alias pride4051 "say again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting"
alias pride4052 "say her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:"
alias pride4053 "say "I did not know before that you ever walked this way.""
alias pride4054 "say "I have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and"
alias pride4055 "say intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?""
alias pride4056 "say "No, I should have turned in a moment.""
alias pride4057 "say And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together."
alias pride4058 "say "Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she."
alias pride4059 "say "Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the"
alias pride4060 "say business just as he pleases.""
alias pride4061 "say "And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great"
alias pride4062 "say power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what"
alias pride4063 "say he likes than Mr. Darcy.""
alias pride4064 "say "He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. "But so we all do."
alias pride4065 "say It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and"
alias pride4066 "say many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to selfdenial"
alias pride4067 "say and dependence.""
alias pride4068 "say "In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously,"
alias pride4069 "say what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented"
alias pride4070 "say by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy"
alias pride4071 "say for?""
alias pride4072 "say "These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many"
alias pride4073 "say hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money."
alias pride4074 "say Younger sons cannot marry where they like.""
alias pride4075 "say "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do." "
alias pride4076 "say "Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life"
alias pride4077 "say who can afford to marry without some attention to money.""
alias pride4078 "say "Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering"
alias pride4079 "say herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son?"
alias pride4080 "say Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand"
alias pride4081 "say pounds.""
alias pride4082 "say He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which"
alias pride4083 "say might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:"
alias pride4084 "say "I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having"
alias pride4085 "say someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that"
alias pride4086 "say kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care,"
alias pride4087 "say he may do what he likes with her.""
alias pride4088 "say "No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am"
alias pride4089 "say joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.""
alias pride4090 "say "Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give"
alias pride4091 "say you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if"
alias pride4092 "say she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.""
alias pride4093 "say As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he"
alias pride4094 "say immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness,"
alias pride4095 "say convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:"
alias pride4096 "say "You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of"
alias pride4097 "say the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of"
alias pride4098 "say my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know"
alias pride4099 "say them.""
alias pride4100 "say "I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man—he is a great friend"
alias pride4101 "say of Darcy's.""
alias pride4102 "say "Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily; "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and"
alias pride4103 "say takes a prodigious deal of care of him.""
alias pride4104 "say "Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he"
alias pride4105 "say most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to"
alias pride4106 "say think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right"
alias pride4107 "say to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.""
alias pride4108 "say "What is it you mean?""
alias pride4109 "say "It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it"
alias pride4110 "say were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing.""
alias pride4111 "say "You may depend upon my not mentioning it." "
alias pride4112 "say "And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told"
alias pride4113 "say me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the"
alias pride4114 "say inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other"
alias pride4115 "say particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man"
alias pride4116 "say to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of"
alias pride4117 "say last summer.""
alias pride4118 "say "Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?""
alias pride4119 "say "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.""
alias pride4120 "say "And what arts did he use to separate them?""
alias pride4121 "say "He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam, smiling. "He only told me what"
alias pride4122 "say I have now told you.""
alias pride4123 "say Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After"
alias pride4124 "say watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful."
alias pride4125 "say "I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your cousin's conduct does"
alias pride4126 "say not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?""
alias pride4127 "say "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?""
alias pride4128 "say "I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's"
alias pride4129 "say inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what"
alias pride4130 "say manner his friend was to be happy. But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know"
alias pride4131 "say none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was"
alias pride4132 "say much affection in the case.""
alias pride4133 "say "That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is a lessening of the honour of"
alias pride4134 "say my cousin's triumph very sadly.""
alias pride4135 "say This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she"
alias pride4136 "say would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation"
alias pride4137 "say talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own"
alias pride4138 "say room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she"
alias pride4139 "say had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with"
alias pride4140 "say whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world two men over whom Mr."
alias pride4141 "say Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures"
alias pride4142 "say taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to"
alias pride4143 "say Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did"
alias pride4144 "say not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had"
alias pride4145 "say suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for"
alias pride4146 "say the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil"
alias pride4147 "say he might have inflicted."
alias pride4148 "say "There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's"
alias pride4149 "say words; and those strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country"
alias pride4150 "say attorney, and another who was in business in London. "
alias pride4151 "say "To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection; all"
alias pride4152 "say loveliness and goodness as she is!—her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and"
alias pride4153 "say her manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though"
alias pride4154 "say with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability"
alias pride4155 "say which he will probably never reach." When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave"
alias pride4156 "say way a little; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr."
alias pride4157 "say Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of"
alias pride4158 "say importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite"
alias pride4159 "say decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by"
alias pride4160 "say the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister."
alias pride4161 "say The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew"
alias pride4162 "say so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it"
alias pride4163 "say determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea."
alias pride4164 "say Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as"
alias pride4165 "say possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his"
alias pride4166 "say apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home."
alias pride4167 "say Chapter 34"
alias pride4168 "say When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible"
alias pride4169 "say against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane"
alias pride4170 "say had written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was"
alias pride4171 "say there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all,"
alias pride4172 "say and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used"
alias pride4173 "say to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with"
alias pride4174 "say itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth"
alias pride4175 "say noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had"
alias pride4176 "say hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been"
alias pride4177 "say able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to"
alias pride4178 "say think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a still greater, that"
alias pride4179 "say in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to"
alias pride4180 "say the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do."
alias pride4181 "say She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to"
alias pride4182 "say go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and"
alias pride4183 "say agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him."
alias pride4184 "say While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her"
alias pride4185 "say spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had"
alias pride4186 "say once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her."
alias pride4187 "say But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her"
alias pride4188 "say utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he "
alias pride4189 "say immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that"
alias pride4190 "say she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and"
alias pride4191 "say then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After"
alias pride4192 "say a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:"
alias pride4193 "say "In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must"
alias pride4194 "say allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.""
alias pride4195 "say Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was"
alias pride4196 "say silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and"
alias pride4197 "say had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides"
alias pride4198 "say those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness"
alias pride4199 "say than of pride. His sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family"
alias pride4200 "say obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which"
alias pride4201 "say seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his"
alias pride4202 "say suit."
alias pride4203 "say In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of"
alias pride4204 "say such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first"
alias pride4205 "say sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language,"
alias pride4206 "say she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with"
alias pride4207 "say patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of"
alias pride4208 "say that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer;"
alias pride4209 "say and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand."
alias pride4210 "say As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He spoke"
alias pride4211 "say of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a"
alias pride4212 "say circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her"
alias pride4213 "say cheeks, and she said:"
alias pride4214 "say "In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of"
alias pride4215 "say obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural"
alias pride4216 "say that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I"
alias pride4217 "say cannot—I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most"
alias pride4218 "say unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously"
alias pride4219 "say done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have"
alias pride4220 "say long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming"
alias pride4221 "say it after this explanation.""
alias pride4222 "say Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face,"
alias pride4223 "say seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became"
alias pride4224 "say pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was"
alias pride4225 "say struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed"
alias pride4226 "say himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful. At length, with a"
alias pride4227 "say voice of forced calmness, he said:"
alias pride4228 "say "And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps,"
alias pride4229 "say wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of"
alias pride4230 "say small importance." "
alias pride4231 "say "I might as well inquire," replied she, "why with so evident a desire of offending and"
alias pride4232 "say insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason,"
alias pride4233 "say and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil?"
alias pride4234 "say But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against"
alias pride4235 "say you—had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any"
alias pride4236 "say consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining,"
alias pride4237 "say perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?""
alias pride4238 "say As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short,"
alias pride4239 "say and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued:"
alias pride4240 "say "I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and"
alias pride4241 "say ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the"
alias pride4242 "say principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other—of exposing one to the"
alias pride4243 "say censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed"
alias pride4244 "say hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.""
alias pride4245 "say She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which"
alias pride4246 "say proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile"
alias pride4247 "say of affected incredulity."
alias pride4248 "say "Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated."
alias pride4249 "say With assumed tranquillity he then replied: "I have no wish of denying that I did"
alias pride4250 "say everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my"
alias pride4251 "say success. Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself.""
alias pride4252 "say Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did"
alias pride4253 "say not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her."
alias pride4254 "say "But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded. Long"
alias pride4255 "say before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in"
alias pride4256 "say the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can"
alias pride4257 "say you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or"
alias pride4258 "say under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?""
alias pride4259 "say "You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy, in a less tranquil"
alias pride4260 "say tone, and with a heightened colour."
alias pride4261 "say "Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?""
alias pride4262 "say "His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great"
alias pride4263 "say indeed.""
alias pride4264 "say "And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. "You have reduced him to his"
alias pride4265 "say present state of poverty—comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages which"
alias pride4266 "say you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life"
alias pride4267 "say of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and"
alias pride4268 "say yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule." "
alias pride4269 "say "And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion"
alias pride4270 "say of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully."
alias pride4271 "say My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping"
alias pride4272 "say in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offenses might have been overlooked, had not"
alias pride4273 "say your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my"
alias pride4274 "say forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I,"
alias pride4275 "say with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being"
alias pride4276 "say impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But"
alias pride4277 "say disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They"
alias pride4278 "say were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your"
alias pride4279 "say connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so"
alias pride4280 "say decidedly beneath my own?""
alias pride4281 "say Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to"
alias pride4282 "say speak with composure when she said:"
alias pride4283 "say "You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected"
alias pride4284 "say me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing"
alias pride4285 "say you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.""
alias pride4286 "say She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:"
alias pride4287 "say "You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have"
alias pride4288 "say tempted me to accept it.""
alias pride4289 "say Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled"
alias pride4290 "say incredulity and mortification. She went on:"
alias pride4291 "say "From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost say—of my"
alias pride4292 "say acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your"
alias pride4293 "say arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to"
alias pride4294 "say form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so"
alias pride4295 "say immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last"
alias pride4296 "say man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.""
alias pride4297 "say "You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have"
alias pride4298 "say now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so"
alias pride4299 "say much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.""
alias pride4300 "say And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment"
alias pride4301 "say open the front door and quit the house."
alias pride4302 "say The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,"
alias pride4303 "say and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she"
alias pride4304 "say reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive"
alias pride4305 "say an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so"
alias pride4306 "say many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which"
alias pride4307 "say had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with"
alias pride4308 "say equal force in his own case—was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired"
alias pride4309 "say unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride—his shameless "
alias pride4310 "say avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane—his unpardonable assurance in"
alias pride4311 "say acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had"
alias pride4312 "say mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon"
alias pride4313 "say overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She"
alias pride4314 "say continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her"
alias pride4315 "say feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her"
alias pride4316 "say room."
alias pride4317 "say Chapter 35"
alias pride4318 "say Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at"
alias pride4319 "say length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it"
alias pride4320 "say was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she"
alias pride4321 "say resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding"
alias pride4322 "say directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there"
alias pride4323 "say stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from"
alias pride4324 "say the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed"
alias pride4325 "say one of the gates into the ground."
alias pride4326 "say After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the"
alias pride4327 "say pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks"
alias pride4328 "say which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every"
alias pride4329 "say day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her"
alias pride4330 "say walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the"
alias pride4331 "say park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly"
alias pride4332 "say retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping"
alias pride4333 "say forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself"
alias pride4334 "say called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the"
alias pride4335 "say gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively"
alias pride4336 "say took, said, with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time"
alias pride4337 "say in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?" And then,"
alias pride4338 "say with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight."
alias pride4339 "say With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the"
alias pride4340 "say letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of"
alias pride4341 "say letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise"
alias pride4342 "say full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight"
alias pride4343 "say o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:—"
alias pride4344 "say "Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing"
alias pride4345 "say any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so"
alias pride4346 "say disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by"
alias pride4347 "say dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the "
alias pride4348 "say effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been"
alias pride4349 "say spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon"
alias pride4350 "say the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it"
alias pride4351 "say unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice."
alias pride4352 "say "Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last"
alias pride4353 "say night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either,"
alias pride4354 "say I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various"
alias pride4355 "say claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the"
alias pride4356 "say prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my"
alias pride4357 "say youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other"
alias pride4358 "say dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion,"
alias pride4359 "say would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could"
alias pride4360 "say be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that"
alias pride4361 "say blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall"
alias pride4362 "say hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their"
alias pride4363 "say motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the"
alias pride4364 "say necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am"
alias pride4365 "say sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd."
alias pride4366 "say "I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley"
alias pride4367 "say preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till the"
alias pride4368 "say evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious"
alias pride4369 "say attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of"
alias pride4370 "say dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental"
alias pride4371 "say information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation"
alias pride4372 "say of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be"
alias pride4373 "say undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then"
alias pride4374 "say perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him."
alias pride4375 "say Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as"
alias pride4376 "say ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the"
alias pride4377 "say evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite"
alias pride4378 "say them by any participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I must have"
alias pride4379 "say been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it be"
alias pride4380 "say so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been"
alias pride4381 "say unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance"
alias pride4382 "say and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however"
alias pride4383 "say amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of"
alias pride4384 "say believing her indifferent is certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and"
alias pride4385 "say decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be"
alias pride4386 "say indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it"
alias pride4387 "say in reason. My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night"
alias pride4388 "say acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of"
alias pride4389 "say connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other causes"
alias pride4390 "say of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both"
alias pride4391 "say instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before"
alias pride4392 "say me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother's family, "
alias pride4393 "say though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so"
alias pride4394 "say frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and"
alias pride4395 "say occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your"
alias pride4396 "say concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation"
alias pride4397 "say of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to"
alias pride4398 "say avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your"
alias pride4399 "say elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say farther"
alias pride4400 "say that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every"
alias pride4401 "say inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I"
alias pride4402 "say esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,"
alias pride4403 "say as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning."
alias pride4404 "say "The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness had been equally"
alias pride4405 "say excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible"
alias pride4406 "say that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him"
alias pride4407 "say directly in London. We accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of"
alias pride4408 "say pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them"
alias pride4409 "say earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his"
alias pride4410 "say determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it"
alias pride4411 "say not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's"
alias pride4412 "say indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with"
alias pride4413 "say equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my"
alias pride4414 "say judgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was"
alias pride4415 "say no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that"
alias pride4416 "say conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for"
alias pride4417 "say having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I"
alias pride4418 "say do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far"
alias pride4419 "say as to conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to"
alias pride4420 "say Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without"
alias pride4421 "say ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough"
alias pride4422 "say extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this"
alias pride4423 "say disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I"
alias pride4424 "say have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's"
alias pride4425 "say feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you"
alias pride4426 "say very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them."
alias pride4427 "say "With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I"
alias pride4428 "say can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what"
alias pride4429 "say he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can"
alias pride4430 "say summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity."
alias pride4431 "say "Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the"
alias pride4432 "say management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his"
alias pride4433 "say trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was"
alias pride4434 "say his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at"
alias pride4435 "say school, and afterwards at Cambridge—most important assistance, as his own father, always"
alias pride4436 "say poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's"
alias pride4437 "say education. My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were "
alias pride4438 "say always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be"
alias pride4439 "say his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since"
alias pride4440 "say I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities—the want"
alias pride4441 "say of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not"
alias pride4442 "say escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had"
alias pride4443 "say opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here"
alias pride4444 "say again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the"
alias pride4445 "say sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me"
alias pride4446 "say from unfolding his real character—it adds even another motive."
alias pride4447 "say "My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was"
alias pride4448 "say to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his"
alias pride4449 "say advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow—and if he took orders,"
alias pride4450 "say desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was"
alias pride4451 "say also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within"
alias pride4452 "say half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally"
alias pride4453 "say resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect"
alias pride4454 "say some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could"
alias pride4455 "say not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware"
alias pride4456 "say that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I"
alias pride4457 "say rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to"
alias pride4458 "say accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business"
alias pride4459 "say was therefore soon settled—he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it"
alias pride4460 "say possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three"
alias pride4461 "say thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him"
alias pride4462 "say to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived,"
alias pride4463 "say but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life"
alias pride4464 "say was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the"
alias pride4465 "say decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me"
alias pride4466 "say again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no"
alias pride4467 "say difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable"
alias pride4468 "say study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the"
alias pride4469 "say living in question—of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured"
alias pride4470 "say that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's"
alias pride4471 "say intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for"
alias pride4472 "say resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his"
alias pride4473 "say circumstances—and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his"
alias pride4474 "say reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped."
alias pride4475 "say How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my"
alias pride4476 "say notice."
alias pride4477 "say "I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no"
alias pride4478 "say obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having"
alias pride4479 "say said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my"
alias pride4480 "say junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and"
alias pride4481 "say myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her"
alias pride4482 "say in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and "
alias pride4483 "say thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a"
alias pride4484 "say prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most"
alias pride4485 "say unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to"
alias pride4486 "say Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a"
alias pride4487 "say child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She"
alias pride4488 "say was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am"
alias pride4489 "say happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day"
alias pride4490 "say or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of"
alias pride4491 "say grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged"
alias pride4492 "say the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit"
alias pride4493 "say and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place"
alias pride4494 "say immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham's"
alias pride4495 "say chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I"
alias pride4496 "say cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement."
alias pride4497 "say His revenge would have been complete indeed."
alias pride4498 "say "This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned"
alias pride4499 "say together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me"
alias pride4500 "say henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form"
alias pride4501 "say of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at."
alias pride4502 "say Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in"
alias pride4503 "say your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination."
alias pride4504 "say "You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then"
alias pride4505 "say master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of"
alias pride4506 "say everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel"
alias pride4507 "say Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one"
alias pride4508 "say of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular"
alias pride4509 "say of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you"
alias pride4510 "say cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be"
alias pride4511 "say the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this"
alias pride4512 "say letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you."
alias pride4513 "say "FITZWILLIAM DARCY""
alias pride4514 "say Chapter 36"
alias pride4515 "say If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of"
alias pride4516 "say his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may"
alias pride4517 "say well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion"
alias pride4518 "say they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she"
alias pride4519 "say first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she"
alias pride4520 "say persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not"
alias pride4521 "say conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of "
alias pride4522 "say what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power"
alias pride4523 "say of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring,"
alias pride4524 "say was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's"
alias pride4525 "say insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst"
alias pride4526 "say objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He"
alias pride4527 "say expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but"
alias pride4528 "say haughty. It was all pride and insolence."
alias pride4529 "say But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham—when she read"
alias pride4530 "say with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every"
alias pride4531 "say cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of"
alias pride4532 "say himself—her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition."
alias pride4533 "say Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it"
alias pride4534 "say entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the"
alias pride4535 "say grossest falsehood!"—and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely"
alias pride4536 "say knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not"
alias pride4537 "say regard it, that she would never look in it again."
alias pride4538 "say In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on;"
alias pride4539 "say but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as"
alias pride4540 "say well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham,"
alias pride4541 "say and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of"
alias pride4542 "say his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the"
alias pride4543 "say kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally"
alias pride4544 "say well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the"
alias pride4545 "say will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her"
alias pride4546 "say memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was"
alias pride4547 "say gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that"
alias pride4548 "say her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the"
alias pride4549 "say particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of"
alias pride4550 "say his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced"
alias pride4551 "say to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be"
alias pride4552 "say impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but with little success. On"
alias pride4553 "say both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that"
alias pride4554 "say the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to"
alias pride4555 "say render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make"
alias pride4556 "say him entirely blameless throughout the whole."
alias pride4557 "say The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham's"
alias pride4558 "say charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice."
alias pride4559 "say She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in which he had"
alias pride4560 "say engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had"
alias pride4561 "say there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in"
alias pride4562 "say Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her"
alias pride4563 "say power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had"
alias pride4564 "say established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some"
alias pride4565 "say instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue"
alias pride4566 "say him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for "
alias pride4567 "say those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had"
alias pride4568 "say described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But no such recollection"
alias pride4569 "say befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address;"
alias pride4570 "say but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the"
alias pride4571 "say neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After"
alias pride4572 "say pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the"
alias pride4573 "say story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what"
alias pride4574 "say had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last"
alias pride4575 "say she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself—from"
alias pride4576 "say whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's"
alias pride4577 "say affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost"
alias pride4578 "say resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the"
alias pride4579 "say application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never"
alias pride4580 "say have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's"
alias pride4581 "say corroboration."
alias pride4582 "say She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham"
alias pride4583 "say and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's. Many of his expressions were still fresh"
alias pride4584 "say in her memory. She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a"
alias pride4585 "say stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself"
alias pride4586 "say forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She"
alias pride4587 "say remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy"
alias pride4588 "say might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the"
alias pride4589 "say Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family"
alias pride4590 "say had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their"
alias pride4591 "say removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in"
alias pride4592 "say sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would"
alias pride4593 "say always prevent his exposing the son."
alias pride4594 "say How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to"
alias pride4595 "say Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the"
alias pride4596 "say mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness"
alias pride4597 "say to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he"
alias pride4598 "say had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by"
alias pride4599 "say encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every"
alias pride4600 "say lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr."
alias pride4601 "say Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago"
alias pride4602 "say asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she"
alias pride4603 "say had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had latterly"
alias pride4604 "say brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways—seen anything"
alias pride4605 "say that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or"
alias pride4606 "say immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued—that even"
alias pride4607 "say Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so"
alias pride4608 "say affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his"
alias pride4609 "say actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right"
alias pride4610 "say could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person"
alias pride4611 "say capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible. "
alias pride4612 "say She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think"
alias pride4613 "say without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd."
alias pride4614 "say "How despicably I have acted!" she cried; "I, who have prided myself on my"
alias pride4615 "say discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the"
alias pride4616 "say generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!"
alias pride4617 "say How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could"
alias pride4618 "say not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with"
alias pride4619 "say the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our"
alias pride4620 "say acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where"
alias pride4621 "say either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.""
alias pride4622 "say From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon"
alias pride4623 "say brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation there had appeared very"
alias pride4624 "say insufficient, and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. How"
alias pride4625 "say could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to"
alias pride4626 "say give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;"
alias pride4627 "say and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been. Neither"
alias pride4628 "say could she deny the justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though"
alias pride4629 "say fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and"
alias pride4630 "say manner not often united with great sensibility."
alias pride4631 "say When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of"
alias pride4632 "say such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the"
alias pride4633 "say charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly"
alias pride4634 "say alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first"
alias pride4635 "say disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers."
alias pride4636 "say The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not"
alias pride4637 "say console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family;"
alias pride4638 "say and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest"
alias pride4639 "say relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety"
alias pride4640 "say of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before."
alias pride4641 "say After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought—"
alias pride4642 "say re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she"
alias pride4643 "say could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long"
alias pride4644 "say absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of"
alias pride4645 "say appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make"
alias pride4646 "say her unfit for conversation."
alias pride4647 "say She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during"
alias pride4648 "say her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take leave—but that Colonel Fitzwilliam"
alias pride4649 "say had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to"
alias pride4650 "say walk after her till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing"
alias pride4651 "say him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she could think"
alias pride4652 "say only of her letter. "
alias pride4653 "say Chapter 37"
alias pride4654 "say The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having been in"
alias pride4655 "say waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the"
alias pride4656 "say pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as"
alias pride4657 "say could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To"
alias pride4658 "say Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return"
alias pride4659 "say brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt"
alias pride4660 "say herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her."
alias pride4661 "say Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she"
alias pride4662 "say might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think,"
alias pride4663 "say without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been. "What would she have"
alias pride4664 "say said? how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself."
alias pride4665 "say Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. "I assure you, I feel it"
alias pride4666 "say exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I"
alias pride4667 "say do. But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much"
alias pride4668 "say attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear"
alias pride4669 "say Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,"
alias pride4670 "say more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.""
alias pride4671 "say Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly"
alias pride4672 "say smiled on by the mother and daughter."
alias pride4673 "say Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and"
alias pride4674 "say immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home"
alias pride4675 "say again so soon, she added:"
alias pride4676 "say "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little"
alias pride4677 "say longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.""
alias pride4678 "say "I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is"
alias pride4679 "say not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday.""
alias pride4680 "say "Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two"
alias pride4681 "say months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so"
alias pride4682 "say soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.""
alias pride4683 "say "But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.""
alias pride4684 "say "Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters are never of so"
alias pride4685 "say much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my"
alias pride4686 "say power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week;"
alias pride4687 "say and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of "
alias pride4688 "say you—and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you"
alias pride4689 "say both, as you are neither of you large.""
alias pride4690 "say "You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan.""
alias pride4691 "say Lady Catherine seemed resigned. "Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You"
alias pride4692 "say know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling"
alias pride4693 "say post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the"
alias pride4694 "say greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly"
alias pride4695 "say guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to"
alias pride4696 "say Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. Miss"
alias pride4697 "say Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared"
alias pride4698 "say with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must"
alias pride4699 "say send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for"
alias pride4700 "say it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.""
alias pride4701 "say "My uncle is to send a servant for us.""
alias pride4702 "say "Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have somebody"
alias pride4703 "say who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you"
alias pride4704 "say mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.""
alias pride4705 "say Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did"
alias pride4706 "say not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky"
alias pride4707 "say for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection"
alias pride4708 "say must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the"
alias pride4709 "say greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in"
alias pride4710 "say all the delight of unpleasant recollections."
alias pride4711 "say Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every"
alias pride4712 "say sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she"
alias pride4713 "say remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she"
alias pride4714 "say considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned"
alias pride4715 "say against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His"
alias pride4716 "say attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him;"
alias pride4717 "say nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see"
alias pride4718 "say him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret;"
alias pride4719 "say and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were"
alias pride4720 "say hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself"
alias pride4721 "say to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so"
alias pride4722 "say far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united"
alias pride4723 "say with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they"
alias pride4724 "say were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?"
alias pride4725 "say Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always"
alias pride4726 "say affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a"
alias pride4727 "say hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they"
alias pride4728 "say would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be"
alias pride4729 "say going there forever. "
alias pride4730 "say Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by"
alias pride4731 "say restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had"
alias pride4732 "say lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,"
alias pride4733 "say unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous"
alias pride4734 "say then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with"
alias pride4735 "say advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum"
alias pride4736 "say of her own family!"
alias pride4737 "say When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's character, it may"
alias pride4738 "say be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now"
alias pride4739 "say so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful."
alias pride4740 "say Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they"
alias pride4741 "say had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired"
alias pride4742 "say minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of"
alias pride4743 "say packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that"
alias pride4744 "say Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack"
alias pride4745 "say her trunk afresh."
alias pride4746 "say When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good"
alias pride4747 "say journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted"
alias pride4748 "say herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both."
alias pride4749 "say Chapter 38"
alias pride4750 "say On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before"
alias pride4751 "say the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he"
alias pride4752 "say deemed indispensably necessary."
alias pride4753 "say "I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense"
alias pride4754 "say of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without"
alias pride4755 "say receiving her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you."
alias pride4756 "say We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of"
alias pride4757 "say living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make"
alias pride4758 "say Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us"
alias pride4759 "say grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent"
alias pride4760 "say your spending your time unpleasantly.""
alias pride4761 "say Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six"
alias pride4762 "say weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind"
alias pride4763 "say attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and"
alias pride4764 "say with a more smiling solemnity replied: "
alias pride4765 "say "It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We"
alias pride4766 "say have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you"
alias pride4767 "say to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of"
alias pride4768 "say varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit"
alias pride4769 "say cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is"
alias pride4770 "say indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on"
alias pride4771 "say what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must"
alias pride4772 "say acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think"
alias pride4773 "say anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at"
alias pride4774 "say Rosings.""
alias pride4775 "say Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk"
alias pride4776 "say about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences."
alias pride4777 "say "You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear"
alias pride4778 "say cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great"
alias pride4779 "say attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not"
alias pride4780 "say appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be as well to be"
alias pride4781 "say silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most"
alias pride4782 "say cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind"
alias pride4783 "say and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character"
alias pride4784 "say and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.""
alias pride4785 "say Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with"
alias pride4786 "say equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts."
alias pride4787 "say She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom"
alias pride4788 "say they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had"
alias pride4789 "say chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go,"
alias pride4790 "say she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her"
alias pride4791 "say poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms."
alias pride4792 "say At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it"
alias pride4793 "say was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth"
alias pride4794 "say was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was"
alias pride4795 "say commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the"
alias pride4796 "say kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs."
alias pride4797 "say Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the"
alias pride4798 "say point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they"
alias pride4799 "say had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings."
alias pride4800 "say "But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to"
alias pride4801 "say them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here.""
alias pride4802 "say Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage"
alias pride4803 "say drove off."
alias pride4804 "say "Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, "it seems but a day or two"
alias pride4805 "say since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!" "
alias pride4806 "say "A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh."
alias pride4807 "say "We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! How much I"
alias pride4808 "say shall have to tell!""
alias pride4809 "say Elizabeth added privately, "And how much I shall have to conceal!""
alias pride4810 "say Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four"
alias pride4811 "say hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to"
alias pride4812 "say remain a few days."
alias pride4813 "say Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the"
alias pride4814 "say various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to"
alias pride4815 "say go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation."
alias pride4816 "say It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before"
alias pride4817 "say she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing"
alias pride4818 "say what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify"
alias pride4819 "say whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation"
alias pride4820 "say to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she"
alias pride4821 "say remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered"
alias pride4822 "say on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only"
alias pride4823 "say grieve her sister further."
alias pride4824 "say Chapter 39"
alias pride4825 "say It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from"
alias pride4826 "say Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the"
alias pride4827 "say appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in"
alias pride4828 "say token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up"
alias pride4829 "say stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an"
alias pride4830 "say opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber."
alias pride4831 "say After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold"
alias pride4832 "say meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable"
alias pride4833 "say surprise?""
alias pride4834 "say "And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia, "but you must lend us the money, for we"
alias pride4835 "say have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then, showing her purchases—"Look here, I"
alias pride4836 "say have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it"
alias pride4837 "say as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.""
alias pride4838 "say And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh! but there"
alias pride4839 "say were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured"
alias pride4840 "say satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify "
alias pride4841 "say what one wears this summer, after the ——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a"
alias pride4842 "say fortnight.""
alias pride4843 "say "Are they indeed!" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction."
alias pride4844 "say "They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there"
alias pride4845 "say for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost"
alias pride4846 "say anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable"
alias pride4847 "say summer else we shall have!""
alias pride4848 "say "Yes," thought Elizabeth, "that would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do"
alias pride4849 "say for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have"
alias pride4850 "say been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!""
alias pride4851 "say "Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down at table. "What do you"
alias pride4852 "say think? It is excellent news—capital news—and about a certain person we all like!""
alias pride4853 "say Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. Lydia"
alias pride4854 "say laughed, and said:"
alias pride4855 "say "Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not"
alias pride4856 "say hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But"
alias pride4857 "say he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but"
alias pride4858 "say now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no"
alias pride4859 "say danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle"
alias pride4860 "say at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.""
alias pride4861 "say "And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to"
alias pride4862 "say fortune.""
alias pride4863 "say "She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.""
alias pride4864 "say "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane."
alias pride4865 "say "I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her—"
alias pride4866 "say who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?""
alias pride4867 "say Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression"
alias pride4868 "say herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured"
alias pride4869 "say and fancied liberal!"
alias pride4870 "say As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some"
alias pride4871 "say contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the"
alias pride4872 "say unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it."
alias pride4873 "say "How nicely we are all crammed in," cried Lydia. "I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is"
alias pride4874 "say only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and"
alias pride4875 "say snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has"
alias pride4876 "say happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had"
alias pride4877 "say any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you"
alias pride4878 "say came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! "
alias pride4879 "say Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt"
alias pride4880 "say Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken"
alias pride4881 "say Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like"
alias pride4882 "say to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear"
alias pride4883 "say me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were"
alias pride4884 "say to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by"
alias pride4885 "say the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to"
alias pride4886 "say come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you"
alias pride4887 "say think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a"
alias pride4888 "say lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty"
alias pride4889 "say and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot"
alias pride4890 "say imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more"
alias pride4891 "say of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did"
alias pride4892 "say Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And that made the men suspect something, and"
alias pride4893 "say then they soon found out what was the matter.""
alias pride4894 "say With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's"
alias pride4895 "say hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn."
alias pride4896 "say Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of"
alias pride4897 "say Wickham's name."
alias pride4898 "say Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished"
alias pride4899 "say beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:"
alias pride4900 "say "I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.""
alias pride4901 "say Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria"
alias pride4902 "say and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was"
alias pride4903 "say inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was"
alias pride4904 "say doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who"
alias pride4905 "say sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and"
alias pride4906 "say Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various"
alias pride4907 "say pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her."
alias pride4908 "say "Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went"
alias pride4909 "say along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I"
alias pride4910 "say should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George,"
alias pride4911 "say I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold"
alias pride4912 "say luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And"
alias pride4913 "say then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the"
alias pride4914 "say coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we"
alias pride4915 "say talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!""
alias pride4916 "say To this Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such"
alias pride4917 "say pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I"
alias pride4918 "say confess they would have no charms for me—I should infinitely prefer a book.""
alias pride4919 "say But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody for more than"
alias pride4920 "say half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all. "
alias pride4921 "say In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see"
alias pride4922 "say how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said"
alias pride4923 "say that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the"
alias pride4924 "say officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham"
alias pride4925 "say again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to her of the regiment's"
alias pride4926 "say approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go—and"
alias pride4927 "say once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account."
alias pride4928 "say She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of"
alias pride4929 "say which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her"
alias pride4930 "say parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but"
alias pride4931 "say his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often"
alias pride4932 "say disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last."
alias pride4933 "say Chapter 40"
alias pride4934 "say Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be"
alias pride4935 "say overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was"
alias pride4936 "say concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief"
alias pride4937 "say of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself."
alias pride4938 "say Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which"
alias pride4939 "say made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost"
alias pride4940 "say in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a"
alias pride4941 "say manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the"
alias pride4942 "say unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him."
alias pride4943 "say "His being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said she, "and certainly ought not to have"
alias pride4944 "say appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment!""
alias pride4945 "say "Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which"
alias pride4946 "say will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for"
alias pride4947 "say refusing him?""
alias pride4948 "say "Blame you! Oh, no.""
alias pride4949 "say "But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?""
alias pride4950 "say "No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.""
alias pride4951 "say "But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day.""
alias pride4952 "say She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned"
alias pride4953 "say George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone"
alias pride4954 "say through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of "
alias pride4955 "say mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though"
alias pride4956 "say grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she"
alias pride4957 "say labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the"
alias pride4958 "say other."
alias pride4959 "say "This will not do," said Elizabeth; "you never will be able to make both of them good for"
alias pride4960 "say anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a"
alias pride4961 "say quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it"
alias pride4962 "say has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's; but"
alias pride4963 "say you shall do as you choose.""
alias pride4964 "say It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane."
alias pride4965 "say "I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she. "Wickham so very bad! It is"
alias pride4966 "say almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have"
alias pride4967 "say suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and"
alias pride4968 "say having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel"
alias pride4969 "say it so.""
alias pride4970 "say "Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I"
alias pride4971 "say know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more"
alias pride4972 "say unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him"
alias pride4973 "say much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.""
alias pride4974 "say "Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an"
alias pride4975 "say openness and gentleness in his manner!""
alias pride4976 "say "There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young"
alias pride4977 "say men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.""
alias pride4978 "say "I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.""
alias pride4979 "say "And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without"
alias pride4980 "say any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of"
alias pride4981 "say that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot"
alias pride4982 "say always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.""
alias pride4983 "say "Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do"
alias pride4984 "say now.""
alias pride4985 "say "Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And with no one"
alias pride4986 "say to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very"
alias pride4987 "say weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!""
alias pride4988 "say "How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of"
alias pride4989 "say Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.""
alias pride4990 "say "Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence"
alias pride4991 "say of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I"
alias pride4992 "say want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general"
alias pride4993 "say understand Wickham's character." "
alias pride4994 "say Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for"
alias pride4995 "say exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?""
alias pride4996 "say "That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his"
alias pride4997 "say communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to"
alias pride4998 "say be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest"
alias pride4999 "say of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent,"
alias pride5000 "say that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an"
alias pride5001 "say amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not"
alias pride5002 "say signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then"
alias pride5003 "say we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about"
alias pride5004 "say it.""
alias pride5005 "say "You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now,"
alias pride5006 "say perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not"
alias pride5007 "say make him desperate.""
alias pride5008 "say The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two"
alias pride5009 "say of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener"
alias pride5010 "say in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something"
alias pride5011 "say lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half"
alias pride5012 "say of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her"
alias pride5013 "say friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that"
alias pride5014 "say nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing"
alias pride5015 "say off this last encumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very improbable event"
alias pride5016 "say should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more"
alias pride5017 "say agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all"
alias pride5018 "say its value!""
alias pride5019 "say She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's"
alias pride5020 "say spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having"
alias pride5021 "say never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,"
alias pride5022 "say and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast;"
alias pride5023 "say and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all"
alias pride5024 "say her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check"
alias pride5025 "say the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their"
alias pride5026 "say tranquillity."
alias pride5027 "say "Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion now of this sad business"
alias pride5028 "say of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my"
alias pride5029 "say sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in"
alias pride5030 "say London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man—and I do not suppose there's the least"
alias pride5031 "say chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to"
alias pride5032 "say Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to"
alias pride5033 "say know.""
alias pride5034 "say "I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more." "
alias pride5035 "say "Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say"
alias pride5036 "say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well,"
alias pride5037 "say my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what"
alias pride5038 "say he has done.""
alias pride5039 "say But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no"
alias pride5040 "say answer."
alias pride5041 "say "Well, Lizzy," continued her mother, soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very"
alias pride5042 "say comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they"
alias pride5043 "say keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she"
alias pride5044 "say is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare say.""
alias pride5045 "say "No, nothing at all.""
alias pride5046 "say "A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. they will take care not to"
alias pride5047 "say outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do"
alias pride5048 "say them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead."
alias pride5049 "say They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.""
alias pride5050 "say "It was a subject which they could not mention before me.""
alias pride5051 "say "No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it"
alias pride5052 "say between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own,"
alias pride5053 "say so much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.""
alias pride5054 "say Chapter 41"
alias pride5055 "say The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the"
alias pride5056 "say regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping"
alias pride5057 "say apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to"
alias pride5058 "say eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently"
alias pride5059 "say were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was"
alias pride5060 "say extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family."
alias pride5061 "say "Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" would they often exclaim"
alias pride5062 "say in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?""
alias pride5063 "say Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself"
alias pride5064 "say endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago."
alias pride5065 "say "I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller's regiment went"
alias pride5066 "say away. I thought I should have broken my heart.""
alias pride5067 "say "I am sure I shall break mine," said Lydia. "
alias pride5068 "say "If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet."
alias pride5069 "say "Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.""
alias pride5070 "say "A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.""
alias pride5071 "say "And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good," added Kitty."
alias pride5072 "say Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House."
alias pride5073 "say Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt"
alias pride5074 "say anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she been so much disposed to"
alias pride5075 "say pardon his interference in the views of his friend."
alias pride5076 "say But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an"
alias pride5077 "say invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to"
alias pride5078 "say Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A"
alias pride5079 "say resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each"
alias pride5080 "say other, and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two."
alias pride5081 "say The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs."
alias pride5082 "say Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to"
alias pride5083 "say her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's"
alias pride5084 "say congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless"
alias pride5085 "say Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was"
alias pride5086 "say peevish."
alias pride5087 "say "I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia," said she, "Though I"
alias pride5088 "say am not her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too,"
alias pride5089 "say for I am two years older.""
alias pride5090 "say In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As"
alias pride5091 "say for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in"
alias pride5092 "say her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of"
alias pride5093 "say common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known,"
alias pride5094 "say she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all"
alias pride5095 "say the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from"
alias pride5096 "say the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more"
alias pride5097 "say imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than"
alias pride5098 "say at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:"
alias pride5099 "say "Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and"
alias pride5100 "say we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as"
alias pride5101 "say under the present circumstances.""
alias pride5102 "say "If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all which must"
alias pride5103 "say arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has"
alias pride5104 "say already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.""
alias pride5105 "say "Already arisen?" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she frightened away some of your"
alias pride5106 "say lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to "
alias pride5107 "say be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of"
alias pride5108 "say pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.""
alias pride5109 "say "Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of particular, but of"
alias pride5110 "say general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world"
alias pride5111 "say must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark"
alias pride5112 "say Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take"
alias pride5113 "say the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits"
alias pride5114 "say are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her"
alias pride5115 "say character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made"
alias pride5116 "say herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation;"
alias pride5117 "say without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and"
alias pride5118 "say emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt"
alias pride5119 "say which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is comprehended. She"
alias pride5120 "say will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my"
alias pride5121 "say dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised"
alias pride5122 "say wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?""
alias pride5123 "say Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her"
alias pride5124 "say hand said in reply:"
alias pride5125 "say "Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known you must be"
alias pride5126 "say respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of—or I"
alias pride5127 "say may say, three—very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not"
alias pride5128 "say go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of"
alias pride5129 "say any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At"
alias pride5130 "say Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The"
alias pride5131 "say officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being"
alias pride5132 "say there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees"
alias pride5133 "say worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life.""
alias pride5134 "say With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the"
alias pride5135 "say same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase"
alias pride5136 "say her vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to"
alias pride5137 "say fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition."
alias pride5138 "say Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their"
alias pride5139 "say indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia's"
alias pride5140 "say imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw,"
alias pride5141 "say with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers."
alias pride5142 "say She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown."
alias pride5143 "say She saw all the glories of the camp—its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of"
alias pride5144 "say lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the"
alias pride5145 "say view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at"
alias pride5146 "say once."
alias pride5147 "say Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as"
alias pride5148 "say these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her"
alias pride5149 "say mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that "
alias pride5150 "say consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there"
alias pride5151 "say himself."
alias pride5152 "say But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with"
alias pride5153 "say little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving home."
alias pride5154 "say Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in"
alias pride5155 "say company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal"
alias pride5156 "say partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first"
alias pride5157 "say delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour"
alias pride5158 "say to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon"
alias pride5159 "say testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance"
alias pride5160 "say could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him"
alias pride5161 "say in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while"
alias pride5162 "say she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that"
alias pride5163 "say however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would"
alias pride5164 "say be gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal."
alias pride5165 "say On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined, with other of the"
alias pride5166 "say officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good"
alias pride5167 "say humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at"
alias pride5168 "say Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three"
alias pride5169 "say weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former."
alias pride5170 "say He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a"
alias pride5171 "say returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he"
alias pride5172 "say was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly"
alias pride5173 "say in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:"
alias pride5174 "say "How long did you say he was at Rosings?""
alias pride5175 "say "Nearly three weeks.""
alias pride5176 "say "And you saw him frequently?""
alias pride5177 "say "Yes, almost every day.""
alias pride5178 "say "His manners are very different from his cousin's.""
alias pride5179 "say "Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.""
alias pride5180 "say "Indeed!" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. "And pray, may I"
alias pride5181 "say ask?—" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves?"
alias pride5182 "say Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not hope," he"
alias pride5183 "say continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials.""
alias pride5184 "say "Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.""
alias pride5185 "say While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her"
alias pride5186 "say words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made"
alias pride5187 "say him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added: "
alias pride5188 "say "When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his"
alias pride5189 "say manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition"
alias pride5190 "say was better understood.""
alias pride5191 "say Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few"
alias pride5192 "say minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said"
alias pride5193 "say in the gentlest of accents:"
alias pride5194 "say "You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how"
alias pride5195 "say sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is"
alias pride5196 "say right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it"
alias pride5197 "say must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the"
alias pride5198 "say sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his"
alias pride5199 "say visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of"
alias pride5200 "say her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed"
alias pride5201 "say to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very"
alias pride5202 "say much at heart.""
alias pride5203 "say Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination"
alias pride5204 "say of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and"
alias pride5205 "say she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the appearance,"
alias pride5206 "say on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and"
alias pride5207 "say they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again."
alias pride5208 "say When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence"
alias pride5209 "say they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was"
alias pride5210 "say rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from"
alias pride5211 "say vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her"
alias pride5212 "say daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of"
alias pride5213 "say enjoying herself as much as possible—advice which there was every reason to believe"
alias pride5214 "say would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding"
alias pride5215 "say farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard."
alias pride5216 "say Chapter 42"
alias pride5217 "say Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed"
alias pride5218 "say a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by"
alias pride5219 "say youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally"
alias pride5220 "say give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in"
alias pride5221 "say their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had"
alias pride5222 "say vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr."
alias pride5223 "say Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own"
alias pride5224 "say imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the"
alias pride5225 "say unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from "
alias pride5226 "say these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise"
alias pride5227 "say indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the"
alias pride5228 "say sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other"
alias pride5229 "say powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as"
alias pride5230 "say are given."
alias pride5231 "say Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a"
alias pride5232 "say husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his"
alias pride5233 "say affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook,"
alias pride5234 "say and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum"
alias pride5235 "say which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly"
alias pride5236 "say reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must"
alias pride5237 "say attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils"
alias pride5238 "say arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least"
alias pride5239 "say have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind"
alias pride5240 "say of his wife."
alias pride5241 "say When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little other cause for"
alias pride5242 "say satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before,"
alias pride5243 "say and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of"
alias pride5244 "say everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty"
alias pride5245 "say might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were"
alias pride5246 "say removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was"
alias pride5247 "say likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a"
alias pride5248 "say watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes"
alias pride5249 "say found before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in"
alias pride5250 "say taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently"
alias pride5251 "say necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity—to have"
alias pride5252 "say some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the"
alias pride5253 "say pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another"
alias pride5254 "say disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was"
alias pride5255 "say her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her"
alias pride5256 "say mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every"
alias pride5257 "say part of it would have been perfect."
alias pride5258 "say "But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for. Were the whole"
alias pride5259 "say arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with me"
alias pride5260 "say one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my"
alias pride5261 "say expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never"
alias pride5262 "say be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little"
alias pride5263 "say peculiar vexation.""
alias pride5264 "say When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother"
alias pride5265 "say and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her"
alias pride5266 "say mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such"
alias pride5267 "say and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as"
alias pride5268 "say made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have"
alias pride5269 "say described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called "
alias pride5270 "say her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there"
alias pride5271 "say was still less to be learnt—for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full"
alias pride5272 "say of lines under the words to be made public."
alias pride5273 "say After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and"
alias pride5274 "say cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The"
alias pride5275 "say families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and"
alias pride5276 "say summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and,"
alias pride5277 "say by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without"
alias pride5278 "say tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following"
alias pride5279 "say Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a"
alias pride5280 "say day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment"
alias pride5281 "say should be quartered in Meryton."
alias pride5282 "say The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a"
alias pride5283 "say fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once"
alias pride5284 "say delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by"
alias pride5285 "say business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a"
alias pride5286 "say month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had"
alias pride5287 "say proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were"
alias pride5288 "say obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the"
alias pride5289 "say present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that county there was"
alias pride5290 "say enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a"
alias pride5291 "say peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life,"
alias pride5292 "say and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her"
alias pride5293 "say curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak."
alias pride5294 "say Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and"
alias pride5295 "say still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied—"
alias pride5296 "say and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again."
alias pride5297 "say With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for"
alias pride5298 "say her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. "But surely," said she, "I"
alias pride5299 "say may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his"
alias pride5300 "say perceiving me.""
alias pride5301 "say The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her"
alias pride5302 "say uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four"
alias pride5303 "say children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years"
alias pride5304 "say old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane,"
alias pride5305 "say who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly"
alias pride5306 "say adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching them, playing with them, and"
alias pride5307 "say loving them."
alias pride5308 "say The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with"
alias pride5309 "say Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain—that of"
alias pride5310 "say suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear"
alias pride5311 "say inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and affection and intelligence,"
alias pride5312 "say which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad. "
alias pride5313 "say It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the"
alias pride5314 "say remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick,"
alias pride5315 "say Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the"
alias pride5316 "say present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former"
alias pride5317 "say residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent"
alias pride5318 "say their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles"
alias pride5319 "say of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their"
alias pride5320 "say direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening"
alias pride5321 "say before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared"
alias pride5322 "say his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation."
alias pride5323 "say "My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her"
alias pride5324 "say aunt; "a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham"
alias pride5325 "say passed all his youth there, you know.""
alias pride5326 "say Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged"
alias pride5327 "say to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great"
alias pride5328 "say houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains."
alias pride5329 "say Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. "If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said"
alias pride5330 "say she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of"
alias pride5331 "say the finest woods in the country.""
alias pride5332 "say Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting"
alias pride5333 "say Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at"
alias pride5334 "say the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a"
alias pride5335 "say risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last"
alias pride5336 "say resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered."
alias pride5337 "say Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley"
alias pride5338 "say were not a very fine place? what was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm,"
alias pride5339 "say whether the family were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last"
alias pride5340 "say question—and her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of"
alias pride5341 "say curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and"
alias pride5342 "say she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that"
alias pride5343 "say she had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go."
alias pride5344 "say Chapter 43"
alias pride5345 "say Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods"
alias pride5346 "say with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a"
alias pride5347 "say high flutter. "
alias pride5348 "say The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of"
alias pride5349 "say its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide"
alias pride5350 "say extent."
alias pride5351 "say Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every"
alias pride5352 "say remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found"
alias pride5353 "say themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was"
alias pride5354 "say instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which"
alias pride5355 "say the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing"
alias pride5356 "say well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of"
alias pride5357 "say some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its"
alias pride5358 "say banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen"
alias pride5359 "say a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little"
alias pride5360 "say counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at"
alias pride5361 "say that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!"
alias pride5362 "say They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining"
alias pride5363 "say the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She"
alias pride5364 "say dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were"
alias pride5365 "say admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to"
alias pride5366 "say wonder at her being where she was."
alias pride5367 "say The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more"
alias pride5368 "say civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It"
alias pride5369 "say was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly"
alias pride5370 "say surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which"
alias pride5371 "say they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful"
alias pride5372 "say object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the"
alias pride5373 "say river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace"
alias pride5374 "say it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different"
alias pride5375 "say positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and"
alias pride5376 "say handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw,"
alias pride5377 "say with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of"
alias pride5378 "say splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings."
alias pride5379 "say "And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might"
alias pride5380 "say now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have"
alias pride5381 "say rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But"
alias pride5382 "say no,"—recollecting herself—"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost"
alias pride5383 "say to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.""
alias pride5384 "say This was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something very like regret."
alias pride5385 "say She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent, but had"
alias pride5386 "say not the courage for it. At length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she"
alias pride5387 "say turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, "But we expect"
alias pride5388 "say him to-morrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own"
alias pride5389 "say journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day! "
alias pride5390 "say Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the likeness of Mr."
alias pride5391 "say Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt"
alias pride5392 "say asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was"
alias pride5393 "say a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought"
alias pride5394 "say up by him at his own expense. "He is now gone into the army," she added; "but I am afraid"
alias pride5395 "say he has turned out very wild.""
alias pride5396 "say Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it."
alias pride5397 "say "And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master—"
alias pride5398 "say and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the other—about eight years ago.""
alias pride5399 "say "I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the"
alias pride5400 "say picture; "it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.""
alias pride5401 "say Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing"
alias pride5402 "say her master."
alias pride5403 "say "Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?""
alias pride5404 "say Elizabeth coloured, and said: "A little.""
alias pride5405 "say "And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?""
alias pride5406 "say "Yes, very handsome.""
alias pride5407 "say "I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer,"
alias pride5408 "say larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master's favourite room, and these"
alias pride5409 "say miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them.""
alias pride5410 "say This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them."
alias pride5411 "say Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was"
alias pride5412 "say only eight years old."
alias pride5413 "say "And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mrs. Gardiner."
alias pride5414 "say "Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!—She"
alias pride5415 "say plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her—"
alias pride5416 "say a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.""
alias pride5417 "say Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her"
alias pride5418 "say communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or"
alias pride5419 "say attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister."
alias pride5420 "say "Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?""
alias pride5421 "say "Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and"
alias pride5422 "say Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.""
alias pride5423 "say "Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate.""
alias pride5424 "say "If your master would marry, you might see more of him." "
alias pride5425 "say "Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for"
alias pride5426 "say him.""
alias pride5427 "say Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his"
alias pride5428 "say credit, I am sure, that you should think so.""
alias pride5429 "say "I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him," replied the other."
alias pride5430 "say Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as"
alias pride5431 "say the housekeeper added, "I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have"
alias pride5432 "say known him ever since he was four years old.""
alias pride5433 "say This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was"
alias pride5434 "say not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was"
alias pride5435 "say awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:"
alias pride5436 "say "There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such"
alias pride5437 "say a master.""
alias pride5438 "say "Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better."
alias pride5439 "say But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are goodnatured"
alias pride5440 "say when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generoushearted"
alias pride5441 "say boy in the world.""
alias pride5442 "say Elizabeth almost stared at her. "Can this be Mr. Darcy?" thought she."
alias pride5443 "say "His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner."
alias pride5444 "say "Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just as affable to the"
alias pride5445 "say poor.""
alias pride5446 "say Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could"
alias pride5447 "say interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the"
alias pride5448 "say rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of"
alias pride5449 "say family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led"
alias pride5450 "say again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded"
alias pride5451 "say together up the great staircase."
alias pride5452 "say "He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived; not like the wild"
alias pride5453 "say young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants"
alias pride5454 "say or servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I"
alias pride5455 "say never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other"
alias pride5456 "say young men.""
alias pride5457 "say "In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth."
alias pride5458 "say "This fine account of him," whispered her aunt as they walked, "is not quite consistent"
alias pride5459 "say with his behaviour to our poor friend.""
alias pride5460 "say "Perhaps we might be deceived.""
alias pride5461 "say "That is not very likely; our authority was too good." "
alias pride5462 "say On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room,"
alias pride5463 "say lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were"
alias pride5464 "say informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to"
alias pride5465 "say the room when last at Pemberley."
alias pride5466 "say "He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the"
alias pride5467 "say windows."
alias pride5468 "say Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room. "And"
alias pride5469 "say this is always the way with him," she added. "Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is"
alias pride5470 "say sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.""
alias pride5471 "say The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to"
alias pride5472 "say be shown. In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art;"
alias pride5473 "say and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some"
alias pride5474 "say drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and"
alias pride5475 "say also more intelligible."
alias pride5476 "say In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the"
alias pride5477 "say attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be"
alias pride5478 "say known to her. At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy,"
alias pride5479 "say with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked"
alias pride5480 "say at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned"
alias pride5481 "say to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been"
alias pride5482 "say taken in his father's lifetime."
alias pride5483 "say There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards"
alias pride5484 "say the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation"
alias pride5485 "say bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable"
alias pride5486 "say than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered"
alias pride5487 "say how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain"
alias pride5488 "say was it in his power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea"
alias pride5489 "say that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as"
alias pride5490 "say she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself,"
alias pride5491 "say she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before;"
alias pride5492 "say she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression."
alias pride5493 "say When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned"
alias pride5494 "say downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who"
alias pride5495 "say met them at the hall-door."
alias pride5496 "say As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her"
alias pride5497 "say uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the"
alias pride5498 "say building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it"
alias pride5499 "say to the stables."
alias pride5500 "say They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it"
alias pride5501 "say was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were"
alias pride5502 "say overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed "
alias pride5503 "say immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and"
alias pride5504 "say spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility."
alias pride5505 "say She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his"
alias pride5506 "say compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance,"
alias pride5507 "say or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure"
alias pride5508 "say the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on"
alias pride5509 "say beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was"
alias pride5510 "say talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face,"
alias pride5511 "say and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the"
alias pride5512 "say alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing"
alias pride5513 "say her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to"
alias pride5514 "say her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in"
alias pride5515 "say her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its"
alias pride5516 "say usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn,"
alias pride5517 "say and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke"
alias pride5518 "say the distraction of his thoughts."
alias pride5519 "say At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without"
alias pride5520 "say saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave."
alias pride5521 "say The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard"
alias pride5522 "say not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was"
alias pride5523 "say overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most"
alias pride5524 "say ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light"
alias pride5525 "say might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his"
alias pride5526 "say way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was"
alias pride5527 "say expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach"
alias pride5528 "say of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived—that moment"
alias pride5529 "say alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness"
alias pride5530 "say of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That he"
alias pride5531 "say should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her"
alias pride5532 "say family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken"
alias pride5533 "say with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last"
alias pride5534 "say address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think,"
alias pride5535 "say or how to account for it."
alias pride5536 "say They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was"
alias pride5537 "say bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were"
alias pride5538 "say approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though"
alias pride5539 "say she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to"
alias pride5540 "say direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene."
alias pride5541 "say Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be,"
alias pride5542 "say where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his"
alias pride5543 "say mind—in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was"
alias pride5544 "say still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there"
alias pride5545 "say had been that in his voice which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of"
alias pride5546 "say pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure. "
alias pride5547 "say At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her,"
alias pride5548 "say and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself."
alias pride5549 "say They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the"
alias pride5550 "say higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to"
alias pride5551 "say wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of"
alias pride5552 "say woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a"
alias pride5553 "say wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a"
alias pride5554 "say triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they"
alias pride5555 "say pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent"
alias pride5556 "say among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They"
alias pride5557 "say crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less"
alias pride5558 "say adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed"
alias pride5559 "say room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which"
alias pride5560 "say bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge,"
alias pride5561 "say and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker,"
alias pride5562 "say could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her"
alias pride5563 "say niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the"
alias pride5564 "say opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr."
alias pride5565 "say Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so"
alias pride5566 "say much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking"
alias pride5567 "say to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow"
alias pride5568 "say manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it"
alias pride5569 "say had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The"
alias pride5570 "say walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before"
alias pride5571 "say they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than"
alias pride5572 "say before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet"
alias pride5573 "say them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other"
alias pride5574 "say path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning"
alias pride5575 "say past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his"
alias pride5576 "say recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of"
alias pride5577 "say the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some"
alias pride5578 "say unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be"
alias pride5579 "say mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more."
alias pride5580 "say Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would"
alias pride5581 "say do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which"
alias pride5582 "say she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking"
alias pride5583 "say the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his"
alias pride5584 "say offer to herself. "What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are? He"
alias pride5585 "say takes them now for people of fashion.""
alias pride5586 "say The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship"
alias pride5587 "say to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the"
alias pride5588 "say expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he"
alias pride5589 "say was surprised by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and"
alias pride5590 "say so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr."
alias pride5591 "say Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that "
alias pride5592 "say he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened"
alias pride5593 "say most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every"
alias pride5594 "say sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners."
alias pride5595 "say The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the"
alias pride5596 "say greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,"
alias pride5597 "say offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of"
alias pride5598 "say the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm"
alias pride5599 "say with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified"
alias pride5600 "say her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was"
alias pride5601 "say extreme, and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From what can it"
alias pride5602 "say proceed? It cannot be for me—it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened."
alias pride5603 "say My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he"
alias pride5604 "say should still love me.""
alias pride5605 "say After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind,"
alias pride5606 "say on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection"
alias pride5607 "say of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs."
alias pride5608 "say Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to"
alias pride5609 "say her support, and consequently preferred her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her"
alias pride5610 "say niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished"
alias pride5611 "say him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and"
alias pride5612 "say accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected—"for your"
alias pride5613 "say housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow;"
alias pride5614 "say and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately"
alias pride5615 "say expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his"
alias pride5616 "say steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with"
alias pride5617 "say whom he had been travelling. "They will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and"
alias pride5618 "say among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his"
alias pride5619 "say sisters.""
alias pride5620 "say Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the"
alias pride5621 "say time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might"
alias pride5622 "say judge by his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged."
alias pride5623 "say "There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more"
alias pride5624 "say particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to"
alias pride5625 "say introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?""
alias pride5626 "say The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in"
alias pride5627 "say what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might"
alias pride5628 "say have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without looking"
alias pride5629 "say farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him"
alias pride5630 "say think really ill of her."
alias pride5631 "say They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not"
alias pride5632 "say comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing"
alias pride5633 "say his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and "
alias pride5634 "say when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile"
alias pride5635 "say behind."
alias pride5636 "say He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself not tired, and they"
alias pride5637 "say stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very"
alias pride5638 "say awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last"
alias pride5639 "say she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with"
alias pride5640 "say great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas"
alias pride5641 "say were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming"
alias pride5642 "say up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was"
alias pride5643 "say declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies"
alias pride5644 "say into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the"
alias pride5645 "say house."
alias pride5646 "say The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to"
alias pride5647 "say be infinitely superior to anything they had expected. "He is perfectly well behaved, polite,"
alias pride5648 "say and unassuming," said her uncle."
alias pride5649 "say "There is something a little stately in him, to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined"
alias pride5650 "say to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some"
alias pride5651 "say people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it.""
alias pride5652 "say "I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was"
alias pride5653 "say really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with"
alias pride5654 "say Elizabeth was very trifling.""
alias pride5655 "say "To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has"
alias pride5656 "say not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell"
alias pride5657 "say me that he was so disagreeable?""
alias pride5658 "say Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when"
alias pride5659 "say they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this"
alias pride5660 "say morning."
alias pride5661 "say "But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle. "Your great"
alias pride5662 "say men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind"
alias pride5663 "say another day, and warn me off his grounds.""
alias pride5664 "say Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing."
alias pride5665 "say "From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I really should not have"
alias pride5666 "say thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor"
alias pride5667 "say Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about"
alias pride5668 "say his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would"
alias pride5669 "say not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed"
alias pride5670 "say us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud"
alias pride5671 "say sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant"
alias pride5672 "say comprehends every virtue." "
alias pride5673 "say Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to"
alias pride5674 "say Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that"
alias pride5675 "say by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very"
alias pride5676 "say different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so"
alias pride5677 "say amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related"
alias pride5678 "say the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without"
alias pride5679 "say actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on."
alias pride5680 "say Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene"
alias pride5681 "say of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too"
alias pride5682 "say much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think"
alias pride5683 "say of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no sooner dined"
alias pride5684 "say than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the"
alias pride5685 "say satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance."
alias pride5686 "say The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for"
alias pride5687 "say any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr."
alias pride5688 "say Darcy's civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister."
alias pride5689 "say Chapter 44"
alias pride5690 "say Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day"
alias pride5691 "say after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the"
alias pride5692 "say inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after"
alias pride5693 "say their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with"
alias pride5694 "say some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining"
alias pride5695 "say with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a"
alias pride5696 "say gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing"
alias pride5697 "say the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her"
alias pride5698 "say relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were"
alias pride5699 "say all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the"
alias pride5700 "say circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a"
alias pride5701 "say new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was"
alias pride5702 "say no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a"
alias pride5703 "say partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the"
alias pride5704 "say perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite amazed"
alias pride5705 "say at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the"
alias pride5706 "say partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly"
alias pride5707 "say anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her."
alias pride5708 "say She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the"
alias pride5709 "say room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle"
alias pride5710 "say and aunt as made everything worse. "
alias pride5711 "say Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With"
alias pride5712 "say astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed"
alias pride5713 "say as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly"
alias pride5714 "say proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only"
alias pride5715 "say exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a"
alias pride5716 "say monosyllable."
alias pride5717 "say Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than"
alias pride5718 "say sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less"
alias pride5719 "say handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her"
alias pride5720 "say manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her"
alias pride5721 "say as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by"
alias pride5722 "say discerning such different feelings."
alias pride5723 "say They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming"
alias pride5724 "say to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a"
alias pride5725 "say visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the"
alias pride5726 "say room. All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any,"
alias pride5727 "say it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he"
alias pride5728 "say expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after"
alias pride5729 "say her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done."
alias pride5730 "say To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself."
alias pride5731 "say They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively"
alias pride5732 "say attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their"
alias pride5733 "say observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from"
alias pride5734 "say those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the"
alias pride5735 "say lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing"
alias pride5736 "say with admiration was evident enough."
alias pride5737 "say Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of"
alias pride5738 "say her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in"
alias pride5739 "say the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to"
alias pride5740 "say whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was"
alias pride5741 "say ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased."
alias pride5742 "say In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how ardently did she"
alias pride5743 "say long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy"
alias pride5744 "say that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the"
alias pride5745 "say notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might"
alias pride5746 "say be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been"
alias pride5747 "say set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard."
alias pride5748 "say Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she"
alias pride5749 "say was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in"
alias pride5750 "say her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and"
alias pride5751 "say a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to"
alias pride5752 "say her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something"
alias pride5753 "say of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, "
alias pride5754 "say before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th"
alias pride5755 "say of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.""
alias pride5756 "say Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to"
alias pride5757 "say ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn."
alias pride5758 "say There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a"
alias pride5759 "say manner which gave them meaning."
alias pride5760 "say It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did"
alias pride5761 "say catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she"
alias pride5762 "say heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her"
alias pride5763 "say that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its"
alias pride5764 "say existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the"
alias pride5765 "say acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few"
alias pride5766 "say months ago would have been a disgrace—when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,"
alias pride5767 "say but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively"
alias pride5768 "say scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the change was so great, and struck so"
alias pride5769 "say forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible."
alias pride5770 "say Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at"
alias pride5771 "say Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or"
alias pride5772 "say unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his"
alias pride5773 "say endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were"
alias pride5774 "say addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and"
alias pride5775 "say Rosings."
alias pride5776 "say Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr."
alias pride5777 "say Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs."
alias pride5778 "say Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss"
alias pride5779 "say Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,"
alias pride5780 "say readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the"
alias pride5781 "say invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away"
alias pride5782 "say her head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary"
alias pride5783 "say embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of"
alias pride5784 "say society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the"
alias pride5785 "say day after the next was fixed on."
alias pride5786 "say Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a"
alias pride5787 "say great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends."
alias pride5788 "say Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and"
alias pride5789 "say on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable"
alias pride5790 "say of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the"
alias pride5791 "say enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her"
alias pride5792 "say uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of"
alias pride5793 "say Bingley, and then hurried away to dress."
alias pride5794 "say But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to"
alias pride5795 "say force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. "
alias pride5796 "say Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with"
alias pride5797 "say her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry."
alias pride5798 "say Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their"
alias pride5799 "say acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his"
alias pride5800 "say politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's"
alias pride5801 "say report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he"
alias pride5802 "say was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,"
alias pride5803 "say however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of"
alias pride5804 "say a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners"
alias pride5805 "say indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the"
alias pride5806 "say intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had"
alias pride5807 "say nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be"
alias pride5808 "say imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was"
alias pride5809 "say acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor."
alias pride5810 "say With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much"
alias pride5811 "say estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly"
alias pride5812 "say understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many"
alias pride5813 "say debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged."
alias pride5814 "say As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the"
alias pride5815 "say evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings"
alias pride5816 "say towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make"
alias pride5817 "say them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had"
alias pride5818 "say almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called."
alias pride5819 "say The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly"
alias pride5820 "say admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now"
alias pride5821 "say heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour,"
alias pride5822 "say and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced."
alias pride5823 "say But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which"
alias pride5824 "say could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,"
alias pride5825 "say but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner"
alias pride5826 "say in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she"
alias pride5827 "say had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental"
alias pride5828 "say meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of"
alias pride5829 "say regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was"
alias pride5830 "say soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such"
alias pride5831 "say a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude—for to"
alias pride5832 "say love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be"
alias pride5833 "say encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She"
alias pride5834 "say respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and"
alias pride5835 "say she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how"
alias pride5836 "say far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy"
alias pride5837 "say told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses."
alias pride5838 "say It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking"
alias pride5839 "say civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, "
alias pride5840 "say for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be"
alias pride5841 "say equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be"
alias pride5842 "say highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore,"
alias pride5843 "say to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little"
alias pride5844 "say to say in reply."
alias pride5845 "say Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the"
alias pride5846 "say day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at"
alias pride5847 "say Pemberley before noon."
alias pride5848 "say Chapter 45"
alias pride5849 "say Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in"
alias pride5850 "say jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be"
alias pride5851 "say to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance"
alias pride5852 "say would now be renewed."
alias pride5853 "say On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern"
alias pride5854 "say aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a"
alias pride5855 "say most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks"
alias pride5856 "say and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn."
alias pride5857 "say In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst"
alias pride5858 "say and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana's reception of"
alias pride5859 "say them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding"
alias pride5860 "say from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves"
alias pride5861 "say inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however,"
alias pride5862 "say did her justice, and pitied her."
alias pride5863 "say By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being"
alias pride5864 "say seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It"
alias pride5865 "say was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour"
alias pride5866 "say to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the"
alias pride5867 "say others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the"
alias pride5868 "say conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join"
alias pride5869 "say in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being"
alias pride5870 "say heard."
alias pride5871 "say Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she"
alias pride5872 "say could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This"
alias pride5873 "say observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been"
alias pride5874 "say seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of"
alias pride5875 "say saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some"
alias pride5876 "say of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house "
alias pride5877 "say might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely"
alias pride5878 "say determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's"
alias pride5879 "say voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her"
alias pride5880 "say family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more."
alias pride5881 "say The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants"
alias pride5882 "say with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take"
alias pride5883 "say place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had"
alias pride5884 "say been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party—for"
alias pride5885 "say though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes,"
alias pride5886 "say nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table."
alias pride5887 "say While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared"
alias pride5888 "say or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering"
alias pride5889 "say the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to"
alias pride5890 "say predominate, she began to regret that he came."
alias pride5891 "say He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from"
alias pride5892 "say the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the"
alias pride5893 "say family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth"
alias pride5894 "say wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to"
alias pride5895 "say be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the"
alias pride5896 "say whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not"
alias pride5897 "say watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive"
alias pride5898 "say curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread"
alias pride5899 "say her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her"
alias pride5900 "say desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her"
alias pride5901 "say brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious"
alias pride5902 "say for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every"
alias pride5903 "say attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the"
alias pride5904 "say imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:"
alias pride5905 "say "Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a"
alias pride5906 "say great loss to your family.""
alias pride5907 "say In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly"
alias pride5908 "say comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections"
alias pride5909 "say connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel"
alias pride5910 "say the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone."
alias pride5911 "say While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion,"
alias pride5912 "say earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her"
alias pride5913 "say eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she"
alias pride5914 "say undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to"
alias pride5915 "say discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her"
alias pride5916 "say partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and,"
alias pride5917 "say perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her"
alias pride5918 "say family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's"
alias pride5919 "say meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, "
alias pride5920 "say except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious"
alias pride5921 "say to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their"
alias pride5922 "say becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that"
alias pride5923 "say it should effect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might"
alias pride5924 "say add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend."
alias pride5925 "say Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley,"
alias pride5926 "say vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered"
alias pride5927 "say in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared"
alias pride5928 "say to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had"
alias pride5929 "say been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more"
alias pride5930 "say and more cheerfully."
alias pride5931 "say Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and"
alias pride5932 "say while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings"
alias pride5933 "say in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her."
alias pride5934 "say Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not"
alias pride5935 "say err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power"
alias pride5936 "say of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss"
alias pride5937 "say Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister."
alias pride5938 "say "How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she cried; "I never in"
alias pride5939 "say my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and"
alias pride5940 "say coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.""
alias pride5941 "say However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with"
alias pride5942 "say coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no"
alias pride5943 "say miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer."
alias pride5944 "say "For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her."
alias pride5945 "say Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all"
alias pride5946 "say handsome. Her nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are"
alias pride5947 "say tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been"
alias pride5948 "say called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp,"
alias pride5949 "say shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency"
alias pride5950 "say without fashion, which is intolerable.""
alias pride5951 "say Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best"
alias pride5952 "say method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him"
alias pride5953 "say at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent,"
alias pride5954 "say however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued:"
alias pride5955 "say "I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find"
alias pride5956 "say that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they"
alias pride5957 "say had been dining at Netherfield, 'She a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But"
alias pride5958 "say afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one"
alias pride5959 "say time." "
alias pride5960 "say "Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but that was only when I"
alias pride5961 "say first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest"
alias pride5962 "say women of my acquaintance.""
alias pride5963 "say He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him"
alias pride5964 "say to say what gave no one any pain but herself."
alias pride5965 "say Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they"
alias pride5966 "say returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of"
alias pride5967 "say everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged"
alias pride5968 "say their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit—of everything but"
alias pride5969 "say himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs."
alias pride5970 "say Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject."
alias pride5971 "say Chapter 46"
alias pride5972 "say Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first"
alias pride5973 "say arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that"
alias pride5974 "say had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by"
alias pride5975 "say the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been"
alias pride5976 "say missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction"
alias pride5977 "say remarkably ill."
alias pride5978 "say They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt,"
alias pride5979 "say leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must first be"
alias pride5980 "say attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all"
alias pride5981 "say their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter"
alias pride5982 "say half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important"
alias pride5983 "say intelligence. It was to this effect:"
alias pride5984 "say "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected"
alias pride5985 "say and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I"
alias pride5986 "say have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all"
alias pride5987 "say gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one"
alias pride5988 "say of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it"
alias pride5989 "say does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both"
alias pride5990 "say sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood."
alias pride5991 "say Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)"
alias pride5992 "say marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father"
alias pride5993 "say can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How"
alias pride5994 "say thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget"
alias pride5995 "say it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not"
alias pride5996 "say missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy,"
alias pride5997 "say they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him "
alias pride5998 "say here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must"
alias pride5999 "say conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to"
alias pride6000 "say make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.""
alias pride6001 "say Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt,"
alias pride6002 "say Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost"
alias pride6003 "say impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first."
alias pride6004 "say "By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be"
alias pride6005 "say more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot"
alias pride6006 "say answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad"
alias pride6007 "say news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham"
alias pride6008 "say and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there"
alias pride6009 "say is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came"
alias pride6010 "say yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though"
alias pride6011 "say Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna"
alias pride6012 "say Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go"
alias pride6013 "say there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the"
alias pride6014 "say alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,"
alias pride6015 "say but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed"
alias pride6016 "say the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen"
alias pride6017 "say to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry"
alias pride6018 "say on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all"
alias pride6019 "say the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no such"
alias pride6020 "say people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn,"
alias pride6021 "say and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely"
alias pride6022 "say grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear"
alias pride6023 "say Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of"
alias pride6024 "say him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in"
alias pride6025 "say town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young"
alias pride6026 "say woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?"
alias pride6027 "say Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their"
alias pride6028 "say marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a"
alias pride6029 "say man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself,"
alias pride6030 "say it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw"
alias pride6031 "say him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a"
alias pride6032 "say matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been"
alias pride6033 "say spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own"
alias pride6034 "say that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient."
alias pride6035 "say Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but"
alias pride6036 "say circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as"
alias pride6037 "say possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it,"
alias pride6038 "say though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with"
alias pride6039 "say Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure I know not;"
alias pride6040 "say but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest"
alias pride6041 "say way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an "
alias pride6042 "say exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will"
alias pride6043 "say immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.""
alias pride6044 "say "Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished"
alias pride6045 "say the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but"
alias pride6046 "say as she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face"
alias pride6047 "say and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in"
alias pride6048 "say whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your"
alias pride6049 "say pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot"
alias pride6050 "say be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.""
alias pride6051 "say "Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then"
alias pride6052 "say recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after"
alias pride6053 "say Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.""
alias pride6054 "say Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be"
alias pride6055 "say gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she"
alias pride6056 "say commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to"
alias pride6057 "say fetch his master and mistress home instantly."
alias pride6058 "say On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so"
alias pride6059 "say miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a"
alias pride6060 "say tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could"
alias pride6061 "say take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.""
alias pride6062 "say "No, I thank you," she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. "There is nothing the"
alias pride6063 "say matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have"
alias pride6064 "say just received from Longbourn.""
alias pride6065 "say She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another"
alias pride6066 "say word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern,"
alias pride6067 "say and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. "I have just had a"
alias pride6068 "say letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger"
alias pride6069 "say sister has left all her friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr."
alias pride6070 "say Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You know him too well to doubt the"
alias pride6071 "say rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for"
alias pride6072 "say ever.""
alias pride6073 "say Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added in a yet more agitated"
alias pride6074 "say voice, "that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what he was. Had I but explained some"
alias pride6075 "say part of it only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been"
alias pride6076 "say known, this could not have happened. But it is all—all too late now.""
alias pride6077 "say "I am grieved indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved—shocked. But is it certain—absolutely"
alias pride6078 "say certain?""
alias pride6079 "say "Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to"
alias pride6080 "say London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.""
alias pride6081 "say "And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?" "
alias pride6082 "say "My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate"
alias pride6083 "say assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But nothing can be done—I know"
alias pride6084 "say very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even"
alias pride6085 "say to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!""
alias pride6086 "say Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence."
alias pride6087 "say "When my eyes were opened to his real character—Oh! had I known what I ought, what I"
alias pride6088 "say dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched"
alias pride6089 "say mistake!""
alias pride6090 "say Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down"
alias pride6091 "say the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon"
alias pride6092 "say observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything must sink under"
alias pride6093 "say such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could"
alias pride6094 "say neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory"
alias pride6095 "say to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly"
alias pride6096 "say calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that"
alias pride6097 "say she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain."
alias pride6098 "say But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia—the humiliation, the"
alias pride6099 "say misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering"
alias pride6100 "say her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a"
alias pride6101 "say pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her"
alias pride6102 "say companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint,"
alias pride6103 "say said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in"
alias pride6104 "say excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything"
alias pride6105 "say could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I"
alias pride6106 "say will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks."
alias pride6107 "say This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at"
alias pride6108 "say Pemberley to-day.""
alias pride6109 "say "Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls"
alias pride6110 "say us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot"
alias pride6111 "say be long.""
alias pride6112 "say He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished"
alias pride6113 "say it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his"
alias pride6114 "say compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away."
alias pride6115 "say As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see"
alias pride6116 "say each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in"
alias pride6117 "say Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so"
alias pride6118 "say full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would"
alias pride6119 "say now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination."
alias pride6120 "say If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment"
alias pride6121 "say will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise—if regard springing from such"
alias pride6122 "say sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising "
alias pride6123 "say on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged,"
alias pride6124 "say nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the"
alias pride6125 "say latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise"
alias pride6126 "say her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go"
alias pride6127 "say with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found"
alias pride6128 "say additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane's"
alias pride6129 "say second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but"
alias pride6130 "say Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of"
alias pride6131 "say her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind,"
alias pride6132 "say she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was"
alias pride6133 "say impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had"
alias pride6134 "say appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this"
alias pride6135 "say she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately"
alias pride6136 "say engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in"
alias pride6137 "say believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an"
alias pride6138 "say easy prey."
alias pride6139 "say She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any"
alias pride6140 "say partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach"
alias pride6141 "say herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as"
alias pride6142 "say their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating"
alias pride6143 "say but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such"
alias pride6144 "say a girl—oh! how acutely did she now feel it!"
alias pride6145 "say She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the"
alias pride6146 "say cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother"
alias pride6147 "say incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that"
alias pride6148 "say nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance,"
alias pride6149 "say and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried"
alias pride6150 "say back in alarm, supposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but"
alias pride6151 "say satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their"
alias pride6152 "say summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with"
alias pride6153 "say trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs."
alias pride6154 "say Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and"
alias pride6155 "say after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance"
alias pride6156 "say in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and"
alias pride6157 "say all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily"
alias pride6158 "say settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. "But what is to be done about Pemberley?""
alias pride6159 "say cried Mrs. Gardiner. "John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?""
alias pride6160 "say "Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That is all settled.""
alias pride6161 "say "What is all settled?" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. "And are"
alias pride6162 "say they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!""
alias pride6163 "say But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and"
alias pride6164 "say confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have"
alias pride6165 "say remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she "
alias pride6166 "say had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be"
alias pride6167 "say written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An"
alias pride6168 "say hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his"
alias pride6169 "say account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery"
alias pride6170 "say of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed,"
alias pride6171 "say seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn."
alias pride6172 "say Chapter 47"
alias pride6173 "say "I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the"
alias pride6174 "say town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge"
alias pride6175 "say as your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young"
alias pride6176 "say man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless,"
alias pride6177 "say and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the"
alias pride6178 "say best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be"
alias pride6179 "say noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is"
alias pride6180 "say not adequate to the risk!""
alias pride6181 "say "Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment."
alias pride6182 "say "Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion. It is really"
alias pride6183 "say too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think"
alias pride6184 "say so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him"
alias pride6185 "say capable of it?""
alias pride6186 "say "Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him"
alias pride6187 "say capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to"
alias pride6188 "say Scotland if that had been the case?""
alias pride6189 "say "In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not"
alias pride6190 "say gone to Scotland.""
alias pride6191 "say "Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption!"
alias pride6192 "say And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.""
alias pride6193 "say "Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the"
alias pride6194 "say purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should"
alias pride6195 "say be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more"
alias pride6196 "say economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.""
alias pride6197 "say "But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be"
alias pride6198 "say private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account,"
alias pride6199 "say was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman"
alias pride6200 "say without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia—what attraction has"
alias pride6201 "say she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every "
alias pride6202 "say chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of"
alias pride6203 "say disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to"
alias pride6204 "say judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other"
alias pride6205 "say objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he"
alias pride6206 "say might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has"
alias pride6207 "say ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and"
alias pride6208 "say think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.""
alias pride6209 "say "But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live"
alias pride6210 "say with him on any terms other than marriage?""
alias pride6211 "say "It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes,"
alias pride6212 "say "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But,"
alias pride6213 "say really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young;"
alias pride6214 "say she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a"
alias pride6215 "say twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been"
alias pride6216 "say allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any"
alias pride6217 "say opinions that came in her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing"
alias pride6218 "say but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her"
alias pride6219 "say power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it?"
alias pride6220 "say susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that"
alias pride6221 "say Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.""
alias pride6222 "say "But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so very ill of Wickham as to"
alias pride6223 "say believe him capable of the attempt.""
alias pride6224 "say "Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former"
alias pride6225 "say conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?"
alias pride6226 "say But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been"
alias pride6227 "say profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as"
alias pride6228 "say false and deceitful as he is insinuating.""
alias pride6229 "say "And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode"
alias pride6230 "say of her intelligence was all alive."
alias pride6231 "say "I do indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. "I told you, the other day, of his infamous"
alias pride6232 "say behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner"
alias pride6233 "say he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him."
alias pride6234 "say And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to"
alias pride6235 "say relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss"
alias pride6236 "say Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to"
alias pride6237 "say the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have"
alias pride6238 "say found her.""
alias pride6239 "say "But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so"
alias pride6240 "say well to understand?""
alias pride6241 "say "Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr."
alias pride6242 "say Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I "
alias pride6243 "say returned home, the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that"
alias pride6244 "say was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make"
alias pride6245 "say our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good"
alias pride6246 "say opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even"
alias pride6247 "say when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her"
alias pride6248 "say eyes to his character never occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the"
alias pride6249 "say deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as this could ensue, you may"
alias pride6250 "say easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.""
alias pride6251 "say "When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe"
alias pride6252 "say them fond of each other?""
alias pride6253 "say "Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had"
alias pride6254 "say anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which"
alias pride6255 "say it could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire"
alias pride6256 "say him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for"
alias pride6257 "say the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention; and,"
alias pride6258 "say consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him"
alias pride6259 "say gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became"
alias pride6260 "say her favourites.""
alias pride6261 "say It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears,"
alias pride6262 "say hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could"
alias pride6263 "say detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was"
alias pride6264 "say never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no"
alias pride6265 "say interval of ease or forgetfulness."
alias pride6266 "say They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached"
alias pride6267 "say Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane"
alias pride6268 "say could not have been wearied by long expectations."
alias pride6269 "say The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the"
alias pride6270 "say house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful"
alias pride6271 "say surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety"
alias pride6272 "say of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome."
alias pride6273 "say Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the"
alias pride6274 "say vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her mother's apartment, immediately"
alias pride6275 "say met her."
alias pride6276 "say Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not"
alias pride6277 "say a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives."
alias pride6278 "say "Not yet," replied Jane. "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be"
alias pride6279 "say well.""
alias pride6280 "say "Is my father in town?" "
alias pride6281 "say "Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.""
alias pride6282 "say "And have you heard from him often?""
alias pride6283 "say "We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had"
alias pride6284 "say arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He"
alias pride6285 "say merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to"
alias pride6286 "say mention.""
alias pride6287 "say "And my mother—how is she? How are you all?""
alias pride6288 "say "My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is up"
alias pride6289 "say stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressingroom."
alias pride6290 "say Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.""
alias pride6291 "say "But you—how are you?" cried Elizabeth. "You look pale. How much you must have"
alias pride6292 "say gone through!""
alias pride6293 "say Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation,"
alias pride6294 "say which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was"
alias pride6295 "say now put an end to by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and"
alias pride6296 "say welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears."
alias pride6297 "say When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already"
alias pride6298 "say asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no"
alias pride6299 "say intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her"
alias pride6300 "say heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and"
alias pride6301 "say that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their"
alias pride6302 "say proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage."
alias pride6303 "say Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation"
alias pride6304 "say together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret,"
alias pride6305 "say invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings"
alias pride6306 "say and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors"
alias pride6307 "say of her daughter must principally be owing."
alias pride6308 "say "If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family,"
alias pride6309 "say this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did"
alias pride6310 "say the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or"
alias pride6311 "say other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well"
alias pride6312 "say looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was"
alias pride6313 "say overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I"
alias pride6314 "say know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is"
alias pride6315 "say to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you"
alias pride6316 "say are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.""
alias pride6317 "say They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances"
alias pride6318 "say of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very"
alias pride6319 "say next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia. "
alias pride6320 "say "Do not give way to useless alarm," added he; "though it is right to be prepared for the"
alias pride6321 "say worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left"
alias pride6322 "say Brighton. In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they"
alias pride6323 "say are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost."
alias pride6324 "say As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to"
alias pride6325 "say Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.""
alias pride6326 "say "Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for."
alias pride6327 "say And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are"
alias pride6328 "say not married already, make them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for"
alias pride6329 "say that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are"
alias pride6330 "say married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am"
alias pride6331 "say in, that I am frighted out of my wits—and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over"
alias pride6332 "say me—such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get"
alias pride6333 "say no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her"
alias pride6334 "say clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh,"
alias pride6335 "say brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.""
alias pride6336 "say But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause,"
alias pride6337 "say could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after"
alias pride6338 "say talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her"
alias pride6339 "say feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters."
alias pride6340 "say Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a"
alias pride6341 "say seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not"
alias pride6342 "say prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and"
alias pride6343 "say judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust"
alias pride6344 "say should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject."
alias pride6345 "say In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily"
alias pride6346 "say engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before. One came from her"
alias pride6347 "say books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and"
alias pride6348 "say no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger"
alias pride6349 "say which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to"
alias pride6350 "say the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to"
alias pride6351 "say Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:"
alias pride6352 "say "This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem"
alias pride6353 "say the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly"
alias pride6354 "say consolation.""
alias pride6355 "say Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the"
alias pride6356 "say event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a"
alias pride6357 "say female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is"
alias pride6358 "say no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour"
alias pride6359 "say towards the undeserving of the other sex." "
alias pride6360 "say Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any"
alias pride6361 "say reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions"
alias pride6362 "say from the evil before them."
alias pride6363 "say In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by"
alias pride6364 "say themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any"
alias pride6365 "say inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations"
alias pride6366 "say over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and"
alias pride6367 "say Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by"
alias pride6368 "say saying, "But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me"
alias pride6369 "say further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything"
alias pride6370 "say before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever.""
alias pride6371 "say "Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on"
alias pride6372 "say Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was"
alias pride6373 "say attentive and kind to the utmost. He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern,"
alias pride6374 "say before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got"
alias pride6375 "say abroad, it hastened his journey.""
alias pride6376 "say "And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their"
alias pride6377 "say intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?""
alias pride6378 "say "Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and"
alias pride6379 "say would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not"
alias pride6380 "say marrying—and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood"
alias pride6381 "say before.""
alias pride6382 "say "And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of"
alias pride6383 "say their being really married?""
alias pride6384 "say "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a little uneasy—a"
alias pride6385 "say little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct"
alias pride6386 "say had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt"
alias pride6387 "say how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on"
alias pride6388 "say knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a"
alias pride6389 "say step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.""
alias pride6390 "say "But not before they went to Brighton?""
alias pride6391 "say "No, I believe not.""
alias pride6392 "say "And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does he know his"
alias pride6393 "say real character?""
alias pride6394 "say "I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed"
alias pride6395 "say him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that"
alias pride6396 "say he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.""
alias pride6397 "say "Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have"
alias pride6398 "say happened!" "
alias pride6399 "say "Perhaps it would have been better," replied her sister. "But to expose the former faults of"
alias pride6400 "say any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We"
alias pride6401 "say acted with the best intentions.""
alias pride6402 "say "Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?""
alias pride6403 "say "He brought it with him for us to see.""
alias pride6404 "say Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:"
alias pride6405 "say "MY DEAR HARRIET,"
alias pride6406 "say "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at"
alias pride6407 "say your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and"
alias pride6408 "say if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the"
alias pride6409 "say world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to"
alias pride6410 "say be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it"
alias pride6411 "say will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia"
alias pride6412 "say Wickham.' What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my"
alias pride6413 "say excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I"
alias pride6414 "say hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next"
alias pride6415 "say ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I"
alias pride6416 "say wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are"
alias pride6417 "say packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good"
alias pride6418 "say journey."
alias pride6419 "say "Your affectionate friend,"
alias pride6420 "say "LYDIA BENNET.""
alias pride6421 "say "Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it. "What a"
alias pride6422 "say letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that she was serious on"
alias pride6423 "say the subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her"
alias pride6424 "say side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!""
alias pride6425 "say "I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My"
alias pride6426 "say mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!""
alias pride6427 "say "Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the"
alias pride6428 "say whole story before the end of the day?""
alias pride6429 "say "I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My"
alias pride6430 "say mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my"
alias pride6431 "say power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might"
alias pride6432 "say possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.""
alias pride6433 "say "Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh that I"
alias pride6434 "say had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.""
alias pride6435 "say "Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure;"
alias pride6436 "say but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies "
alias pride6437 "say so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to"
alias pride6438 "say Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday"
alias pride6439 "say with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind;"
alias pride6440 "say she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any"
alias pride6441 "say of her daughters', if they should be of use to us.""
alias pride6442 "say "She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she meant well, but,"
alias pride6443 "say under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is"
alias pride6444 "say impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be"
alias pride6445 "say satisfied.""
alias pride6446 "say She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue,"
alias pride6447 "say while in town, for the recovery of his daughter."
alias pride6448 "say "He meant I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed"
alias pride6449 "say horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them. His principal"
alias pride6450 "say object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from"
alias pride6451 "say Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of"
alias pride6452 "say a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he"
alias pride6453 "say meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the"
alias pride6454 "say coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it"
alias pride6455 "say might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any"
alias pride6456 "say other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so"
alias pride6457 "say greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.""
alias pride6458 "say Chapter 48"
alias pride6459 "say The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post"
alias pride6460 "say came in without bringing a single line from him. His family knew him to be, on all common"
alias pride6461 "say occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped"
alias pride6462 "say for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but"
alias pride6463 "say even of that they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the"
alias pride6464 "say letters before he set off."
alias pride6465 "say When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what"
alias pride6466 "say was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to"
alias pride6467 "say Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as"
alias pride6468 "say the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel."
alias pride6469 "say Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the"
alias pride6470 "say former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their"
alias pride6471 "say attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom."
alias pride6472 "say Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of"
alias pride6473 "say cheering and heartening them up—though, as she never came without reporting some fresh "
alias pride6474 "say instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving"
alias pride6475 "say them more dispirited than she found them."
alias pride6476 "say All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been"
alias pride6477 "say almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and"
alias pride6478 "say his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every"
alias pride6479 "say tradesman's family. Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;"
alias pride6480 "say and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his"
alias pride6481 "say goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough"
alias pride6482 "say to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed"
alias pride6483 "say still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if"
alias pride6484 "say they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in"
alias pride6485 "say all probability have gained some news of them."
alias pride6486 "say Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him;"
alias pride6487 "say it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded"
alias pride6488 "say him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham,"
alias pride6489 "say before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now"
alias pride6490 "say determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible"
alias pride6491 "say they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured"
alias pride6492 "say lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his"
alias pride6493 "say brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr. Bennet"
alias pride6494 "say seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very"
alias pride6495 "say soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:"
alias pride6496 "say "I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the"
alias pride6497 "say young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections"
alias pride6498 "say who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there"
alias pride6499 "say were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it"
alias pride6500 "say might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster"
alias pride6501 "say will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second"
alias pride6502 "say thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other"
alias pride6503 "say person.""
alias pride6504 "say Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority"
alias pride6505 "say proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as"
alias pride6506 "say the compliment deserved. She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a"
alias pride6507 "say father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that"
alias pride6508 "say some of his companions in the ——shire might be able to give more information; and"
alias pride6509 "say though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look"
alias pride6510 "say forward to."
alias pride6511 "say Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was"
alias pride6512 "say when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's"
alias pride6513 "say impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be"
alias pride6514 "say communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance."
alias pride6515 "say But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a"
alias pride6516 "say different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that "
alias pride6517 "say came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what"
alias pride6518 "say curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:"
alias pride6519 "say "MY DEAR SIR,"
alias pride6520 "say "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with"
alias pride6521 "say you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday"
alias pride6522 "say informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and"
alias pride6523 "say myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your present"
alias pride6524 "say distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no"
alias pride6525 "say time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a"
alias pride6526 "say misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the"
alias pride6527 "say most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in"
alias pride6528 "say comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as"
alias pride6529 "say my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has"
alias pride6530 "say proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation"
alias pride6531 "say of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be"
alias pride6532 "say naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever"
alias pride6533 "say that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs."
alias pride6534 "say Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair."
alias pride6535 "say They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to"
alias pride6536 "say the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will"
alias pride6537 "say connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me moreover to"
alias pride6538 "say reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been"
alias pride6539 "say otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise"
alias pride6540 "say you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child"
alias pride6541 "say from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense."
alias pride6542 "say "I am, dear sir, etc., etc.""
alias pride6543 "say Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and"
alias pride6544 "say then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a"
alias pride6545 "say single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no"
alias pride6546 "say near one living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the"
alias pride6547 "say militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them."
alias pride6548 "say There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him."
alias pride6549 "say And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for"
alias pride6550 "say secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired"
alias pride6551 "say that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster"
alias pride6552 "say believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at"
alias pride6553 "say Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable."
alias pride6554 "say Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane"
alias pride6555 "say heard them with horror. "A gamester!" she cried. "This is wholly unexpected. I had not an"
alias pride6556 "say idea of it.""
alias pride6557 "say Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the"
alias pride6558 "say following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their"
alias pride6559 "say endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his "
alias pride6560 "say family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for"
alias pride6561 "say continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much"
alias pride6562 "say satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been"
alias pride6563 "say before."
alias pride6564 "say "What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" she cried. "Sure he will not leave"
alias pride6565 "say London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he"
alias pride6566 "say comes away?""
alias pride6567 "say As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children"
alias pride6568 "say should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore,"
alias pride6569 "say took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn."
alias pride6570 "say Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend"
alias pride6571 "say that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily"
alias pride6572 "say mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner"
alias pride6573 "say had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth"
alias pride6574 "say had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley."
alias pride6575 "say The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her"
alias pride6576 "say spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though"
alias pride6577 "say Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was"
alias pride6578 "say perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of"
alias pride6579 "say Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night"
alias pride6580 "say out of two."
alias pride6581 "say When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure."
alias pride6582 "say He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business"
alias pride6583 "say that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of"
alias pride6584 "say it."
alias pride6585 "say It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to"
alias pride6586 "say introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have"
alias pride6587 "say endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my"
alias pride6588 "say own doing, and I ought to feel it.""
alias pride6589 "say "You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth."
alias pride6590 "say "You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No,"
alias pride6591 "say Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being"
alias pride6592 "say overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.""
alias pride6593 "say "Do you suppose them to be in London?""
alias pride6594 "say "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?""
alias pride6595 "say "And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty."
alias pride6596 "say "She is happy then," said her father drily; "and her residence there will probably be of"
alias pride6597 "say some duration." "
alias pride6598 "say Then after a short silence he continued:"
alias pride6599 "say "Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,"
alias pride6600 "say considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.""
alias pride6601 "say They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea."
alias pride6602 "say "This is a parade," he cried, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to"
alias pride6603 "say misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and"
alias pride6604 "say powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty"
alias pride6605 "say runs away.""
alias pride6606 "say "I am not going to run away, papa," said Kitty fretfully. "If I should ever go to Brighton, I"
alias pride6607 "say would behave better than Lydia.""
alias pride6608 "say "You go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No,"
alias pride6609 "say Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is"
alias pride6610 "say ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be"
alias pride6611 "say absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir"
alias pride6612 "say out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational"
alias pride6613 "say manner.""
alias pride6614 "say Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry."
alias pride6615 "say "Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next"
alias pride6616 "say ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.""
alias pride6617 "say Chapter 49"
alias pride6618 "say Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the"
alias pride6619 "say shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and,"
alias pride6620 "say concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but,"
alias pride6621 "say instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I"
alias pride6622 "say beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some"
alias pride6623 "say good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.""
alias pride6624 "say "What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.""
alias pride6625 "say "Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an"
alias pride6626 "say express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half-hour, and master"
alias pride6627 "say has had a letter.""
alias pride6628 "say Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the"
alias pride6629 "say vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; and"
alias pride6630 "say they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by"
alias pride6631 "say the butler, who said: "
alias pride6632 "say "If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse.""
alias pride6633 "say Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across"
alias pride6634 "say the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on"
alias pride6635 "say one side of the paddock."
alias pride6636 "say Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged"
alias pride6637 "say behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:"
alias pride6638 "say "Oh, papa, what news—what news? Have you heard from my uncle?""
alias pride6639 "say "Yes I have had a letter from him by express.""
alias pride6640 "say "Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?""
alias pride6641 "say "What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket. "But"
alias pride6642 "say perhaps you would like to read it.""
alias pride6643 "say Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up."
alias pride6644 "say "Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about.""
alias pride6645 "say "Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2."
alias pride6646 "say "MY DEAR BROTHER,"
alias pride6647 "say "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I"
alias pride6648 "say hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate"
alias pride6649 "say enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet;"
alias pride6650 "say it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen them both—""
alias pride6651 "say "Then it is as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!""
alias pride6652 "say Elizabeth read on:"
alias pride6653 "say "I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of"
alias pride6654 "say being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make"
alias pride6655 "say on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to"
alias pride6656 "say assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured"
alias pride6657 "say among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter"
alias pride6658 "say into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These"
alias pride6659 "say are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far"
alias pride6660 "say as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost"
alias pride6661 "say in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr."
alias pride6662 "say Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The"
alias pride6663 "say world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little"
alias pride6664 "say money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own"
alias pride6665 "say fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name"
alias pride6666 "say throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for"
alias pride6667 "say preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to"
alias pride6668 "say town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send "
alias pride6669 "say back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it"
alias pride6670 "say best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve."
alias pride6671 "say She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on."
alias pride6672 "say Yours, etc.,"
alias pride6673 "say "EDW. GARDINER.""
alias pride6674 "say "Is it possible?" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. "Can it be possible that he will"
alias pride6675 "say marry her?""
alias pride6676 "say "Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him," said her sister. "My dear"
alias pride6677 "say father, I congratulate you.""
alias pride6678 "say "And have you answered the letter?" cried Elizabeth."
alias pride6679 "say "No; but it must be done soon.""
alias pride6680 "say Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he wrote."
alias pride6681 "say "Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back and write immediately. Consider how"
alias pride6682 "say important every moment is in such a case.""
alias pride6683 "say "Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself.""
alias pride6684 "say "I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done.""
alias pride6685 "say And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house."
alias pride6686 "say "And may I ask—" said Elizabeth; "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.""
alias pride6687 "say "Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.""
alias pride6688 "say "And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!""
alias pride6689 "say "Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things"
alias pride6690 "say that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring"
alias pride6691 "say it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.""
alias pride6692 "say "Money! My uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, sir?""
alias pride6693 "say "I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one"
alias pride6694 "say hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.""
alias pride6695 "say "That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to"
alias pride6696 "say be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous,"
alias pride6697 "say good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.""
alias pride6698 "say "No," said her father; "Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten"
alias pride6699 "say thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our"
alias pride6700 "say relationship.""
alias pride6701 "say "Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?" "
alias pride6702 "say Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they"
alias pride6703 "say reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into"
alias pride6704 "say the breakfast-room."
alias pride6705 "say "And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves."
alias pride6706 "say "How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is"
alias pride6707 "say their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh,"
alias pride6708 "say Lydia!""
alias pride6709 "say "I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia"
alias pride6710 "say if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards"
alias pride6711 "say clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been"
alias pride6712 "say advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten"
alias pride6713 "say thousand pounds?""
alias pride6714 "say "If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and"
alias pride6715 "say how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has"
alias pride6716 "say done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle"
alias pride6717 "say and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal"
alias pride6718 "say protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot"
alias pride6719 "say enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not"
alias pride6720 "say make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when"
alias pride6721 "say she first sees my aunt!""
alias pride6722 "say "We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and"
alias pride6723 "say trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is"
alias pride6724 "say come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter"
alias pride6725 "say myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make"
alias pride6726 "say their past imprudence forgotten.""
alias pride6727 "say "Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can"
alias pride6728 "say ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.""
alias pride6729 "say It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of"
alias pride6730 "say what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he"
alias pride6731 "say would not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head,"
alias pride6732 "say coolly replied:"
alias pride6733 "say "Just as you please.""
alias pride6734 "say "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?""
alias pride6735 "say "Take whatever you like, and get away.""
alias pride6736 "say Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs together. Mary"
alias pride6737 "say and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all."
alias pride6738 "say After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could"
alias pride6739 "say hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon"
alias pride6740 "say married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was"
alias pride6741 "say now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and "
alias pride6742 "say vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by"
alias pride6743 "say no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct."
alias pride6744 "say "My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried. "This is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall"
alias pride6745 "say see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would"
alias pride6746 "say be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham"
alias pride6747 "say too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them"
alias pride6748 "say directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her."
alias pride6749 "say Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a"
alias pride6750 "say moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!""
alias pride6751 "say Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports,"
alias pride6752 "say by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all"
alias pride6753 "say under."
alias pride6754 "say "For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure to his"
alias pride6755 "say kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with"
alias pride6756 "say money.""
alias pride6757 "say "Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he"
alias pride6758 "say had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know;"
alias pride6759 "say and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I"
alias pride6760 "say am so happy! In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it"
alias pride6761 "say sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am"
alias pride6762 "say sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father"
alias pride6763 "say about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.""
alias pride6764 "say She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would"
alias pride6765 "say shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty,"
alias pride6766 "say persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she"
alias pride6767 "say observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so"
alias pride6768 "say obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head."
alias pride6769 "say "I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to"
alias pride6770 "say my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run"
alias pride6771 "say down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls,"
alias pride6772 "say can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard"
alias pride6773 "say the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch"
alias pride6774 "say to make merry at her wedding.""
alias pride6775 "say Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her congratulations"
alias pride6776 "say amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might"
alias pride6777 "say think with freedom."
alias pride6778 "say Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had"
alias pride6779 "say need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational"
alias pride6780 "say happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to"
alias pride6781 "say what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had"
alias pride6782 "say gained. "
alias pride6783 "say Chapter 50"
alias pride6784 "say Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending"
alias pride6785 "say his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and"
alias pride6786 "say of his wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in"
alias pride6787 "say that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or"
alias pride6788 "say credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most"
alias pride6789 "say worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper"
alias pride6790 "say place."
alias pride6791 "say He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be"
alias pride6792 "say forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to"
alias pride6793 "say find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could."
alias pride6794 "say When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of"
alias pride6795 "say course, they were to have a son. The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he"
alias pride6796 "say should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for."
alias pride6797 "say Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs."
alias pride6798 "say Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at"
alias pride6799 "say last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for"
alias pride6800 "say economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their"
alias pride6801 "say income."
alias pride6802 "say Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children."
alias pride6803 "say But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the"
alias pride6804 "say parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and"
alias pride6805 "say Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of"
alias pride6806 "say grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely,"
alias pride6807 "say he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness"
alias pride6808 "say to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that,"
alias pride6809 "say could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little"
alias pride6810 "say inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a"
alias pride6811 "say year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket"
alias pride6812 "say allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother's"
alias pride6813 "say hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within that sum."
alias pride6814 "say That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very"
alias pride6815 "say welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as"
alias pride6816 "say possible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her"
alias pride6817 "say were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched;"
alias pride6818 "say for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to"
alias pride6819 "say know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with"
alias pride6820 "say Lydia to send any message to her. "
alias pride6821 "say The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through"
alias pride6822 "say the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would"
alias pride6823 "say have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the"
alias pride6824 "say town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant"
alias pride6825 "say farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured"
alias pride6826 "say wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in"
alias pride6827 "say Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an"
alias pride6828 "say husband her misery was considered certain."
alias pride6829 "say It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day she again"
alias pride6830 "say took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of"
alias pride6831 "say shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first"
alias pride6832 "say object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and"
alias pride6833 "say her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins,"
alias pride6834 "say new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a"
alias pride6835 "say proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income"
alias pride6836 "say might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance."
alias pride6837 "say "Haye Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings could quit it—or the great house at"
alias pride6838 "say Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have"
alias pride6839 "say her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.""
alias pride6840 "say Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But"
alias pride6841 "say when they had withdrawn, he said to her: "Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these"
alias pride6842 "say houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in"
alias pride6843 "say this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of"
alias pride6844 "say either, by receiving them at Longbourn.""
alias pride6845 "say A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It soon led to another;"
alias pride6846 "say and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a"
alias pride6847 "say guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no"
alias pride6848 "say mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That"
alias pride6849 "say his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his"
alias pride6850 "say daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all"
alias pride6851 "say she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new"
alias pride6852 "say clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping"
alias pride6853 "say and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place."
alias pride6854 "say Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment,"
alias pride6855 "say been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage"
alias pride6856 "say would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal"
alias pride6857 "say its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot."
alias pride6858 "say She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few people on"
alias pride6859 "say whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was"
alias pride6860 "say no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much—not,"
alias pride6861 "say however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there"
alias pride6862 "say seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most"
alias pride6863 "say honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a "
alias pride6864 "say family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of"
alias pride6865 "say the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned."
alias pride6866 "say From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The wish of"
alias pride6867 "say procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not"
alias pride6868 "say in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she"
alias pride6869 "say repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she"
alias pride6870 "say could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed"
alias pride6871 "say the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy"
alias pride6872 "say with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet."
alias pride6873 "say What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which"
alias pride6874 "say she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been most gladly and"
alias pride6875 "say gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex;"
alias pride6876 "say but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph."
alias pride6877 "say She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and"
alias pride6878 "say talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would"
alias pride6879 "say have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both;"
alias pride6880 "say by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and"
alias pride6881 "say from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received"
alias pride6882 "say benefit of greater importance."
alias pride6883 "say But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial"
alias pride6884 "say felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the"
alias pride6885 "say other, was soon to be formed in their family."
alias pride6886 "say How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not"
alias pride6887 "say imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only"
alias pride6888 "say brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily"
alias pride6889 "say conjecture."
alias pride6890 "say Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he"
alias pride6891 "say briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family;"
alias pride6892 "say and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The"
alias pride6893 "say principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on"
alias pride6894 "say quitting the militia."
alias pride6895 "say "It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was"
alias pride6896 "say fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as"
alias pride6897 "say highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go"
alias pride6898 "say into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and"
alias pride6899 "say willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——'s"
alias pride6900 "say regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of"
alias pride6901 "say the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each"
alias pride6902 "say have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel"
alias pride6903 "say Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the "
alias pride6904 "say various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy"
alias pride6905 "say payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of"
alias pride6906 "say carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list"
alias pride6907 "say according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not"
alias pride6908 "say deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will"
alias pride6909 "say then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from"
alias pride6910 "say Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South."
alias pride6911 "say She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.—Yours, etc.,"
alias pride6912 "say "E. GARDINER.""
alias pride6913 "say Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the —"
alias pride6914 "say —shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with"
alias pride6915 "say it. Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in"
alias pride6916 "say her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire,"
alias pride6917 "say was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken"
alias pride6918 "say from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites."
alias pride6919 "say "She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away!"
alias pride6920 "say And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not"
alias pride6921 "say be so pleasant in General ——'s regiment.""
alias pride6922 "say His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family"
alias pride6923 "say again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and"
alias pride6924 "say Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence,"
alias pride6925 "say that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so"
alias pride6926 "say rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were"
alias pride6927 "say married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their"
alias pride6928 "say mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter"
alias pride6929 "say in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again"
alias pride6930 "say to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as"
alias pride6931 "say soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was"
alias pride6932 "say surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted"
alias pride6933 "say only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her"
alias pride6934 "say wishes."
alias pride6935 "say Chapter 51"
alias pride6936 "say Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than"
alias pride6937 "say she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it"
alias pride6938 "say by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more"
alias pride6939 "say especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been"
alias pride6940 "say the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. "
alias pride6941 "say They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles"
alias pride6942 "say decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked"
alias pride6943 "say impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy."
alias pride6944 "say Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the"
alias pride6945 "say room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave"
alias pride6946 "say her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them"
alias pride6947 "say both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness."
alias pride6948 "say Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His"
alias pride6949 "say countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance"
alias pride6950 "say of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even"
alias pride6951 "say Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and"
alias pride6952 "say fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at"
alias pride6953 "say length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration"
alias pride6954 "say in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there."
alias pride6955 "say Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so"
alias pride6956 "say pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles"
alias pride6957 "say and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all."
alias pride6958 "say Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,"
alias pride6959 "say resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man."
alias pride6960 "say She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion"
alias pride6961 "say suffered no variation of colour."
alias pride6962 "say There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast"
alias pride6963 "say enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his"
alias pride6964 "say acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable"
alias pride6965 "say to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the"
alias pride6966 "say world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects"
alias pride6967 "say which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world."
alias pride6968 "say "Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a"
alias pride6969 "say fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good"
alias pride6970 "say gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back"
alias pride6971 "say again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.""
alias pride6972 "say Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia;"
alias pride6973 "say but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily"
alias pride6974 "say continued, "Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid"
alias pride6975 "say they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he"
alias pride6976 "say should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let"
alias pride6977 "say my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed"
alias pride6978 "say and smiled like anything.""
alias pride6979 "say Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no"
alias pride6980 "say more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined"
alias pride6981 "say them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, "
alias pride6982 "say and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go"
alias pride6983 "say lower, because I am a married woman.""
alias pride6984 "say It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she"
alias pride6985 "say had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs."
alias pride6986 "say Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs."
alias pride6987 "say Wickham" by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring,"
alias pride6988 "say and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids."
alias pride6989 "say "Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what"
alias pride6990 "say do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy"
alias pride6991 "say me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the"
alias pride6992 "say place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.""
alias pride6993 "say "Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your"
alias pride6994 "say going such a way off. Must it be so?""
alias pride6995 "say "Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and"
alias pride6996 "say my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare"
alias pride6997 "say say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.""
alias pride6998 "say "I should like it beyond anything!" said her mother."
alias pride6999 "say "And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I"
alias pride7000 "say dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.""
alias pride7001 "say "I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like"
alias pride7002 "say your way of getting husbands.""
alias pride7003 "say Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received"
alias pride7004 "say his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a"
alias pride7005 "say fortnight."
alias pride7006 "say No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the"
alias pride7007 "say most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at"
alias pride7008 "say home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable"
alias pride7009 "say to such as did think, than such as did not."
alias pride7010 "say Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal"
alias pride7011 "say to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the"
alias pride7012 "say reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather"
alias pride7013 "say than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose"
alias pride7014 "say to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by"
alias pride7015 "say distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an"
alias pride7016 "say opportunity of having a companion."
alias pride7017 "say Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no"
alias pride7018 "say one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she"
alias pride7019 "say was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the"
alias pride7020 "say country. "
alias pride7021 "say One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she"
alias pride7022 "say said to Elizabeth:"
alias pride7023 "say "Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I"
alias pride7024 "say told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?""
alias pride7025 "say "No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.""
alias pride7026 "say "La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you"
alias pride7027 "say know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled"
alias pride7028 "say that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together;"
alias pride7029 "say and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in"
alias pride7030 "say such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I"
alias pride7031 "say should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing,"
alias pride7032 "say preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear"
alias pride7033 "say above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed"
alias pride7034 "say to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.""
alias pride7035 "say "Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the"
alias pride7036 "say bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was"
alias pride7037 "say with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a"
alias pride7038 "say fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but,"
alias pride7039 "say however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my"
alias pride7040 "say uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know,"
alias pride7041 "say when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know"
alias pride7042 "say what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could"
alias pride7043 "say not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we"
alias pride7044 "say all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the"
alias pride7045 "say wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.""
alias pride7046 "say "Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement."
alias pride7047 "say "Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite"
alias pride7048 "say forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will"
alias pride7049 "say Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!""
alias pride7050 "say "If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the subject. You may depend"
alias pride7051 "say upon my seeking no further.""
alias pride7052 "say "Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no"
alias pride7053 "say questions.""
alias pride7054 "say "Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then"
alias pride7055 "say Wickham would be angry.""
alias pride7056 "say On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by"
alias pride7057 "say running away."
alias pride7058 "say But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not"
alias pride7059 "say to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, "
alias pride7060 "say and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go."
alias pride7061 "say Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was"
alias pride7062 "say satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light,"
alias pride7063 "say seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of"
alias pride7064 "say paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if"
alias pride7065 "say it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended."
alias pride7066 "say "You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a"
alias pride7067 "say person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family,"
alias pride7068 "say should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand"
alias pride7069 "say it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to"
alias pride7070 "say think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.""
alias pride7071 "say "Not that I shall, though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear"
alias pride7072 "say aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks"
alias pride7073 "say and stratagems to find it out.""
alias pride7074 "say Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of"
alias pride7075 "say what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till it appeared whether her inquiries"
alias pride7076 "say would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante."
alias pride7077 "say Chapter 52"
alias pride7078 "say Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly"
alias pride7079 "say could. She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she"
alias pride7080 "say was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be"
alias pride7081 "say happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial."
alias pride7082 "say "Gracechurch street, Sept. 6."
alias pride7083 "say "MY DEAR NIECE,"
alias pride7084 "say "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I"
alias pride7085 "say foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself"
alias pride7086 "say surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don't think me angry, however,"
alias pride7087 "say for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on"
alias pride7088 "say your side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as"
alias pride7089 "say much surprised as I am—and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would"
alias pride7090 "say have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must"
alias pride7091 "say be more explicit."
alias pride7092 "say "On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most"
alias pride7093 "say unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all"
alias pride7094 "say over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have"
alias pride7095 "say been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. "
alias pride7096 "say Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,"
alias pride7097 "say Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and"
alias pride7098 "say came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his"
alias pride7099 "say conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well"
alias pride7100 "say known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in"
alias pride7101 "say him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had"
alias pride7102 "say before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was"
alias pride7103 "say to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy"
alias pride7104 "say an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would"
alias pride7105 "say never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them;"
alias pride7106 "say but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the"
alias pride7107 "say consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us."
alias pride7108 "say "There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss"
alias pride7109 "say Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did"
alias pride7110 "say not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself"
alias pride7111 "say by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham;"
alias pride7112 "say and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three"
alias pride7113 "say days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I"
alias pride7114 "say suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be"
alias pride7115 "say found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been"
alias pride7116 "say able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At"
alias pride7117 "say length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ——"
alias pride7118 "say street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her,"
alias pride7119 "say he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and"
alias pride7120 "say return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his"
alias pride7121 "say assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining"
alias pride7122 "say where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not"
alias pride7123 "say hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it"
alias pride7124 "say did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to"
alias pride7125 "say secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he"
alias pride7126 "say easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,"
alias pride7127 "say on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all"
alias pride7128 "say the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his"
alias pride7129 "say commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about"
alias pride7130 "say it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing"
alias pride7131 "say to live on."
alias pride7132 "say "Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet"
alias pride7133 "say was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his"
alias pride7134 "say situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that"
alias pride7135 "say Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in"
alias pride7136 "say some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof"
alias pride7137 "say against the temptation of immediate relief."
alias pride7138 "say "They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted"
alias pride7139 "say more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. "
alias pride7140 "say "Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle"
alias pride7141 "say acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home."
alias pride7142 "say But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your"
alias pride7143 "say father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your"
alias pride7144 "say father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily"
alias pride7145 "say postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and"
alias pride7146 "say till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business."
alias pride7147 "say "On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said"
alias pride7148 "say before, they had a great deal of talk together."
alias pride7149 "say "They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before"
alias pride7150 "say Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very"
alias pride7151 "say obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has"
alias pride7152 "say been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. Nothing was to be"
alias pride7153 "say done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,"
alias pride7154 "say therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole."
alias pride7155 "say "They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or"
alias pride7156 "say lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of"
alias pride7157 "say being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable"
alias pride7158 "say credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning"
alias pride7159 "say gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his"
alias pride7160 "say borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther"
alias pride7161 "say than yourself, or Jane at most."
alias pride7162 "say "You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts"
alias pride7163 "say are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another"
alias pride7164 "say thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The"
alias pride7165 "say reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was"
alias pride7166 "say owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had"
alias pride7167 "say been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was."
alias pride7168 "say Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody's"
alias pride7169 "say reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy,"
alias pride7170 "say you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not"
alias pride7171 "say given him credit for another interest in the affair."
alias pride7172 "say "When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at"
alias pride7173 "say Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding"
alias pride7174 "say took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish."
alias pride7175 "say "I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give"
alias pride7176 "say you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us;"
alias pride7177 "say and Wickham had constant admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been, when"
alias pride7178 "say I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her"
alias pride7179 "say behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday,"
alias pride7180 "say that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now"
alias pride7181 "say tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,"
alias pride7182 "say representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had "
alias pride7183 "say brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen."
alias pride7184 "say I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for"
alias pride7185 "say their sakes had patience with her."
alias pride7186 "say "Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding."
alias pride7187 "say He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday."
alias pride7188 "say Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I"
alias pride7189 "say was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in"
alias pride7190 "say every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and"
alias pride7191 "say opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry"
alias pride7192 "say prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your"
alias pride7193 "say name. But slyness seems the fashion."
alias pride7194 "say "Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to"
alias pride7195 "say exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low"
alias pride7196 "say phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing."
alias pride7197 "say "But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour."
alias pride7198 "say "Yours, very sincerely,"
alias pride7199 "say "M. GARDINER.""
alias pride7200 "say The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult"
alias pride7201 "say to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled"
alias pride7202 "say suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to"
alias pride7203 "say forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness"
alias pride7204 "say too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of"
alias pride7205 "say obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them"
alias pride7206 "say purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on"
alias pride7207 "say such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must"
alias pride7208 "say abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,"
alias pride7209 "say persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very"
alias pride7210 "say name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could"
alias pride7211 "say neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a"
alias pride7212 "say hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was"
alias pride7213 "say insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her—for a woman who had"
alias pride7214 "say already refused him—as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against"
alias pride7215 "say relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt"
alias pride7216 "say from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much."
alias pride7217 "say But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of"
alias pride7218 "say belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he"
alias pride7219 "say had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal"
alias pride7220 "say inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his"
alias pride7221 "say endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was"
alias pride7222 "say painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who"
alias pride7223 "say could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing,"
alias pride7224 "say to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever"
alias pride7225 "say encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was "
alias pride7226 "say humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had"
alias pride7227 "say been able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him again"
alias pride7228 "say and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure,"
alias pride7229 "say though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been"
alias pride7230 "say persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself."
alias pride7231 "say She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before"
alias pride7232 "say she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham."
alias pride7233 "say "I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her."
alias pride7234 "say "You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption"
alias pride7235 "say must be unwelcome.""
alias pride7236 "say "I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are"
alias pride7237 "say better.""
alias pride7238 "say "True. Are the others coming out?""
alias pride7239 "say "I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my"
alias pride7240 "say dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.""
alias pride7241 "say She replied in the affirmative."
alias pride7242 "say "I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I"
alias pride7243 "say could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor"
alias pride7244 "say Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to"
alias pride7245 "say you.""
alias pride7246 "say "Yes, she did.""
alias pride7247 "say "And what did she say?""
alias pride7248 "say "That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not turned out well. At such"
alias pride7249 "say a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.""
alias pride7250 "say "Certainly," he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon"
alias pride7251 "say afterwards said:"
alias pride7252 "say "I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I"
alias pride7253 "say wonder what he can be doing there.""
alias pride7254 "say "Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth. "It must be"
alias pride7255 "say something particular, to take him there at this time of year.""
alias pride7256 "say "Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from"
alias pride7257 "say the Gardiners that you had.""
alias pride7258 "say "Yes; he introduced us to his sister.""
alias pride7259 "say "And do you like her?""
alias pride7260 "say "Very much.""
alias pride7261 "say "I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I"
alias pride7262 "say last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn"
alias pride7263 "say out well.""
alias pride7264 "say "I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.""
alias pride7265 "say "Did you go by the village of Kympton?""
alias pride7266 "say "I do not recollect that we did.""
alias pride7267 "say "I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful"
alias pride7268 "say place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.""
alias pride7269 "say "How should you have liked making sermons?""
alias pride7270 "say "Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would"
alias pride7271 "say soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such"
alias pride7272 "say a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of"
alias pride7273 "say happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when"
alias pride7274 "say you were in Kent?""
alias pride7275 "say "I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally"
alias pride7276 "say only, and at the will of the present patron.""
alias pride7277 "say "You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the first, you may"
alias pride7278 "say remember.""
alias pride7279 "say "I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you"
alias pride7280 "say as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking"
alias pride7281 "say orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.""
alias pride7282 "say "You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you"
alias pride7283 "say on that point, when first we talked of it.""
alias pride7284 "say They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him;"
alias pride7285 "say and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a goodhumoured"
alias pride7286 "say smile:"
alias pride7287 "say "Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about"
alias pride7288 "say the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.""
alias pride7289 "say She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew"
alias pride7290 "say how to look, and they entered the house."
alias pride7291 "say Chapter 53 "
alias pride7292 "say Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again"
alias pride7293 "say distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it;"
alias pride7294 "say and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet."
alias pride7295 "say The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to"
alias pride7296 "say a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going"
alias pride7297 "say to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth."
alias pride7298 "say "Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?""
alias pride7299 "say "Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.""
alias pride7300 "say "Write to me very often, my dear.""
alias pride7301 "say "As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My"
alias pride7302 "say sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to do.""
alias pride7303 "say Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He smiled, looked"
alias pride7304 "say handsome, and said many pretty things."
alias pride7305 "say "He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I"
alias pride7306 "say saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I"
alias pride7307 "say defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.""
alias pride7308 "say The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days."
alias pride7309 "say "I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends. One"
alias pride7310 "say seems so forlorn without them.""
alias pride7311 "say "This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth. "It"
alias pride7312 "say must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.""
alias pride7313 "say "It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her"
alias pride7314 "say husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have"
alias pride7315 "say gone so soon.""
alias pride7316 "say But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her"
alias pride7317 "say mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in"
alias pride7318 "say circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of"
alias pride7319 "say her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs."
alias pride7320 "say Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns."
alias pride7321 "say "Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs. Phillips first brought"
alias pride7322 "say her the news). "Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to"
alias pride7323 "say us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very"
alias pride7324 "say welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that"
alias pride7325 "say is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it."
alias pride7326 "say And so, is it quite certain he is coming?""
alias pride7327 "say "You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I"
alias pride7328 "say saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me "
alias pride7329 "say that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on"
alias pride7330 "say Wednesday. She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat"
alias pride7331 "say on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.""
alias pride7332 "say Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was"
alias pride7333 "say many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were"
alias pride7334 "say alone together, she said:"
alias pride7335 "say "I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I"
alias pride7336 "say know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only"
alias pride7337 "say confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you that the"
alias pride7338 "say news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes"
alias pride7339 "say alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other"
alias pride7340 "say people's remarks.""
alias pride7341 "say Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she"
alias pride7342 "say might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was"
alias pride7343 "say acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater"
alias pride7344 "say probability of his coming there with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come"
alias pride7345 "say without it."
alias pride7346 "say "Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house"
alias pride7347 "say which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I will leave him to himself.""
alias pride7348 "say In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the"
alias pride7349 "say expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it."
alias pride7350 "say They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them."
alias pride7351 "say The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a"
alias pride7352 "say twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again."
alias pride7353 "say "As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you will wait on him"
alias pride7354 "say of course.""
alias pride7355 "say "No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he"
alias pride7356 "say should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's"
alias pride7357 "say errand again.""
alias pride7358 "say His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from"
alias pride7359 "say all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield."
alias pride7360 "say "'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he. "If he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows"
alias pride7361 "say where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go"
alias pride7362 "say away and come back again.""
alias pride7363 "say "Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But,"
alias pride7364 "say however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have"
alias pride7365 "say Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be"
alias pride7366 "say just room at table for him." "
alias pride7367 "say Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility;"
alias pride7368 "say though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in"
alias pride7369 "say consequence of it, before they did. As the day of his arrival drew near,—"
alias pride7370 "say "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister. "It would be nothing; I"
alias pride7371 "say could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually"
alias pride7372 "say talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I"
alias pride7373 "say suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!""
alias pride7374 "say "I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of"
alias pride7375 "say my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is"
alias pride7376 "say denied me, because you have always so much.""
alias pride7377 "say Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have"
alias pride7378 "say the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as"
alias pride7379 "say long as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be"
alias pride7380 "say sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in"
alias pride7381 "say Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride"
alias pride7382 "say towards the house."
alias pride7383 "say Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at"
alias pride7384 "say the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window—she looked,—she saw"
alias pride7385 "say Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister."
alias pride7386 "say "There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?""
alias pride7387 "say "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.""
alias pride7388 "say "La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. Mr."
alias pride7389 "say what's-his-name. That tall, proud man.""
alias pride7390 "say "Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's"
alias pride7391 "say will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of"
alias pride7392 "say him.""
alias pride7393 "say Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting"
alias pride7394 "say in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing"
alias pride7395 "say him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were"
alias pride7396 "say uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their"
alias pride7397 "say mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as"
alias pride7398 "say Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of"
alias pride7399 "say uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to"
alias pride7400 "say shew Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane,"
alias pride7401 "say he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had"
alias pride7402 "say undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the"
alias pride7403 "say whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an"
alias pride7404 "say interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley."
alias pride7405 "say Her astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and"
alias pride7406 "say voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing"
alias pride7407 "say his altered behaviour in Derbyshire. "
alias pride7408 "say The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an"
alias pride7409 "say additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space"
alias pride7410 "say of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure."
alias pride7411 "say "Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for"
alias pride7412 "say expectation.""
alias pride7413 "say She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes,"
alias pride7414 "say till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching"
alias pride7415 "say the door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected."
alias pride7416 "say On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable"
alias pride7417 "say ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or"
alias pride7418 "say any unnecessary complaisance."
alias pride7419 "say Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work,"
alias pride7420 "say with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at"
alias pride7421 "say Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in"
alias pride7422 "say Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her"
alias pride7423 "say mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an"
alias pride7424 "say improbable, conjecture."
alias pride7425 "say Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking"
alias pride7426 "say both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility"
alias pride7427 "say which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and"
alias pride7428 "say ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend."
alias pride7429 "say Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of"
alias pride7430 "say her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful"
alias pride7431 "say degree by a distinction so ill applied."
alias pride7432 "say Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could"
alias pride7433 "say not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps"
alias pride7434 "say that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked"
alias pride7435 "say to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without"
alias pride7436 "say bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of"
alias pride7437 "say curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at"
alias pride7438 "say herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to"
alias pride7439 "say please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry"
alias pride7440 "say with herself for being so."
alias pride7441 "say "Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did he come?""
alias pride7442 "say She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had"
alias pride7443 "say hardly courage to speak."
alias pride7444 "say She inquired after his sister, but could do no more."
alias pride7445 "say "It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs. Bennet."
alias pride7446 "say He readily agreed to it. "
alias pride7447 "say "I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit"
alias pride7448 "say the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes"
alias pride7449 "say have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and"
alias pride7450 "say settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must"
alias pride7451 "say have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not"
alias pride7452 "say put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia"
alias pride7453 "say Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or"
alias pride7454 "say anything. It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make"
alias pride7455 "say such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?""
alias pride7456 "say Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her"
alias pride7457 "say eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell."
alias pride7458 "say "It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her"
alias pride7459 "say mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way"
alias pride7460 "say from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there"
alias pride7461 "say they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard"
alias pride7462 "say of his leaving the ——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has"
alias pride7463 "say some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.""
alias pride7464 "say Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that"
alias pride7465 "say she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which"
alias pride7466 "say nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to"
alias pride7467 "say make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed."
alias pride7468 "say "When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will"
alias pride7469 "say come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be"
alias pride7470 "say vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.""
alias pride7471 "say Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the"
alias pride7472 "say same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was"
alias pride7473 "say persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt"
alias pride7474 "say that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful"
alias pride7475 "say confusion."
alias pride7476 "say "The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with"
alias pride7477 "say either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as"
alias pride7478 "say this! Let me never see either one or the other again!""
alias pride7479 "say Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received"
alias pride7480 "say soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled"
alias pride7481 "say the admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but"
alias pride7482 "say little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as"
alias pride7483 "say handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so"
alias pride7484 "say chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really"
alias pride7485 "say persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did"
alias pride7486 "say not always know when she was silent. "
alias pride7487 "say When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility,"
alias pride7488 "say and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time."
alias pride7489 "say "You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town"
alias pride7490 "say last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have"
alias pride7491 "say not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come"
alias pride7492 "say back and keep your engagement.""
alias pride7493 "say Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having"
alias pride7494 "say been prevented by business. They then went away."
alias pride7495 "say Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but,"
alias pride7496 "say though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses"
alias pride7497 "say could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the"
alias pride7498 "say appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year."
alias pride7499 "say Chapter 54"
alias pride7500 "say As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words,"
alias pride7501 "say to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's"
alias pride7502 "say behaviour astonished and vexed her."
alias pride7503 "say "Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?""
alias pride7504 "say She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure."
alias pride7505 "say "He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and"
alias pride7506 "say why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent?"
alias pride7507 "say Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about him.""
alias pride7508 "say Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who"
alias pride7509 "say joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than"
alias pride7510 "say Elizabeth."
alias pride7511 "say "Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own"
alias pride7512 "say strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on"
alias pride7513 "say Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and"
alias pride7514 "say indifferent acquaintance.""
alias pride7515 "say "Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. "Oh, Jane, take care.""
alias pride7516 "say "My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?""
alias pride7517 "say "I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever." "
alias pride7518 "say They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile,"
alias pride7519 "say was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness"
alias pride7520 "say of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived."
alias pride7521 "say On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most"
alias pride7522 "say anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time."
alias pride7523 "say When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley"
alias pride7524 "say would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister."
alias pride7525 "say Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On"
alias pride7526 "say entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to"
alias pride7527 "say smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her."
alias pride7528 "say Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble"
alias pride7529 "say indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be"
alias pride7530 "say happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of"
alias pride7531 "say half-laughing alarm."
alias pride7532 "say His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an admiration of her,"
alias pride7533 "say which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to"
alias pride7534 "say himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not"
alias pride7535 "say depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It"
alias pride7536 "say gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour."
alias pride7537 "say Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them. He was on one side of"
alias pride7538 "say her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make"
alias pride7539 "say either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she"
alias pride7540 "say could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner"
alias pride7541 "say whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him"
alias pride7542 "say more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be"
alias pride7543 "say privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the"
alias pride7544 "say family."
alias pride7545 "say She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them"
alias pride7546 "say together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into"
alias pride7547 "say something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his"
alias pride7548 "say entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the"
alias pride7549 "say gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She"
alias pride7550 "say looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the"
alias pride7551 "say evening must depend."
alias pride7552 "say "If he does not come to me, then," said she, "I shall give him up for ever.""
alias pride7553 "say The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes;"
alias pride7554 "say but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and"
alias pride7555 "say Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single"
alias pride7556 "say vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of"
alias pride7557 "say the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:"
alias pride7558 "say "The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them; do we?" "
alias pride7559 "say Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes,"
alias pride7560 "say envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to"
alias pride7561 "say coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!"
alias pride7562 "say "A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a"
alias pride7563 "say renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a"
alias pride7564 "say weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to"
alias pride7565 "say their feelings!""
alias pride7566 "say She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she"
alias pride7567 "say seized the opportunity of saying:"
alias pride7568 "say "Is your sister at Pemberley still?""
alias pride7569 "say "Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.""
alias pride7570 "say "And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?""
alias pride7571 "say "Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three"
alias pride7572 "say weeks.""
alias pride7573 "say She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might"
alias pride7574 "say have better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on"
alias pride7575 "say the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away."
alias pride7576 "say When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and"
alias pride7577 "say Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown"
alias pride7578 "say by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments"
alias pride7579 "say after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They"
alias pride7580 "say were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his"
alias pride7581 "say eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as"
alias pride7582 "say unsuccessfully as herself."
alias pride7583 "say Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their"
alias pride7584 "say carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of"
alias pride7585 "say detaining them."
alias pride7586 "say "Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day?"
alias pride7587 "say I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well"
alias pride7588 "say dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody said they"
alias pride7589 "say never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases'"
alias pride7590 "say last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well"
alias pride7591 "say done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never"
alias pride7592 "say saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not."
alias pride7593 "say And what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield"
alias pride7594 "say at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and her"
alias pride7595 "say nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.""
alias pride7596 "say Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's"
alias pride7597 "say behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of "
alias pride7598 "say advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was"
alias pride7599 "say quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals."
alias pride7600 "say "It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. "The party seemed so"
alias pride7601 "say well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.""
alias pride7602 "say Elizabeth smiled."
alias pride7603 "say "Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I"
alias pride7604 "say have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without"
alias pride7605 "say having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he"
alias pride7606 "say never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater"
alias pride7607 "say sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.""
alias pride7608 "say "You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to"
alias pride7609 "say it every moment.""
alias pride7610 "say "How hard it is in some cases to be believed!""
alias pride7611 "say "And how impossible in others!""
alias pride7612 "say "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?""
alias pride7613 "say "That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though"
alias pride7614 "say we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in"
alias pride7615 "say indifference, do not make me your confidante.""
alias pride7616 "say Chapter 55"
alias pride7617 "say A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him"
alias pride7618 "say that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above"
alias pride7619 "say an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them;"
alias pride7620 "say but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere."
alias pride7621 "say "Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky.""
alias pride7622 "say He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave,"
alias pride7623 "say would take an early opportunity of waiting on them."
alias pride7624 "say "Can you come to-morrow?""
alias pride7625 "say Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with"
alias pride7626 "say alacrity."
alias pride7627 "say He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran"
alias pride7628 "say Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished,"
alias pride7629 "say crying out: "
alias pride7630 "say "My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley is come. He is,"
alias pride7631 "say indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help"
alias pride7632 "say her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair.""
alias pride7633 "say "We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than"
alias pride7634 "say either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.""
alias pride7635 "say "Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your"
alias pride7636 "say sash, my dear?""
alias pride7637 "say But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one"
alias pride7638 "say of her sisters."
alias pride7639 "say The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea,"
alias pride7640 "say Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her"
alias pride7641 "say instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and"
alias pride7642 "say winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression"
alias pride7643 "say on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently"
alias pride7644 "say said, "What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?""
alias pride7645 "say "Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but"
alias pride7646 "say unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come"
alias pride7647 "say here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look"
alias pride7648 "say at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she would"
alias pride7649 "say not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called out:"
alias pride7650 "say "Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.""
alias pride7651 "say Elizabeth was forced to go."
alias pride7652 "say "We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother, as soon as she"
alias pride7653 "say was in the hall. "Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room.""
alias pride7654 "say Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till"
alias pride7655 "say she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room."
alias pride7656 "say Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was"
alias pride7657 "say charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered"
alias pride7658 "say him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged"
alias pride7659 "say officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and"
alias pride7660 "say command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter."
alias pride7661 "say He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement"
alias pride7662 "say was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning"
alias pride7663 "say to shoot with her husband."
alias pride7664 "say After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the"
alias pride7665 "say sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must"
alias pride7666 "say speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously,"
alias pride7667 "say however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that"
alias pride7668 "say gentleman's concurrence. "
alias pride7669 "say Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning"
alias pride7670 "say together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion"
alias pride7671 "say expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his"
alias pride7672 "say ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric,"
alias pride7673 "say than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the"
alias pride7674 "say evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and"
alias pride7675 "say her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that"
alias pride7676 "say purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be"
alias pride7677 "say wanted to counteract her mother's schemes."
alias pride7678 "say But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her"
alias pride7679 "say infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On"
alias pride7680 "say opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as"
alias pride7681 "say if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as"
alias pride7682 "say they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their"
alias pride7683 "say situation was awkward enough; but hers she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was"
alias pride7684 "say uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who"
alias pride7685 "say as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister,"
alias pride7686 "say ran out of the room."
alias pride7687 "say Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and"
alias pride7688 "say instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest"
alias pride7689 "say creature in the world."
alias pride7690 "say "'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not"
alias pride7691 "say everybody as happy?""
alias pride7692 "say Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words"
alias pride7693 "say could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to"
alias pride7694 "say Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be"
alias pride7695 "say said for the present."
alias pride7696 "say "I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not on any account trifle with her"
alias pride7697 "say affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my"
alias pride7698 "say father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all"
alias pride7699 "say my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!""
alias pride7700 "say She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and"
alias pride7701 "say was sitting up stairs with Kitty."
alias pride7702 "say Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an"
alias pride7703 "say affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and"
alias pride7704 "say vexation."
alias pride7705 "say "And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his"
alias pride7706 "say sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!""
alias pride7707 "say In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been"
alias pride7708 "say short and to the purpose. "
alias pride7709 "say "Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door."
alias pride7710 "say "With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.""
alias pride7711 "say He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a"
alias pride7712 "say sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their"
alias pride7713 "say relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she"
alias pride7714 "say had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite"
alias pride7715 "say of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally"
alias pride7716 "say founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent"
alias pride7717 "say disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself."
alias pride7718 "say It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's"
alias pride7719 "say mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than"
alias pride7720 "say ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could"
alias pride7721 "say not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,"
alias pride7722 "say though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined"
alias pride7723 "say them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was."
alias pride7724 "say Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for"
alias pride7725 "say the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:"
alias pride7726 "say "Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.""
alias pride7727 "say Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness."
alias pride7728 "say "You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so"
alias pride7729 "say happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no"
alias pride7730 "say means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so"
alias pride7731 "say easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your"
alias pride7732 "say income.""
alias pride7733 "say "I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable"
alias pride7734 "say in me.""
alias pride7735 "say "Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of?"
alias pride7736 "say Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more." Then addressing her"
alias pride7737 "say daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all"
alias pride7738 "say night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not"
alias pride7739 "say be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into"
alias pride7740 "say Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is"
alias pride7741 "say the handsomest young man that ever was seen!""
alias pride7742 "say Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child. At"
alias pride7743 "say that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with"
alias pride7744 "say her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense."
alias pride7745 "say Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a"
alias pride7746 "say few balls there every winter. "
alias pride7747 "say Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently"
alias pride7748 "say before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous"
alias pride7749 "say neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which"
alias pride7750 "say he thought himself obliged to accept."
alias pride7751 "say Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was"
alias pride7752 "say present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably"
alias pride7753 "say useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the"
alias pride7754 "say absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her;"
alias pride7755 "say and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief."
alias pride7756 "say "He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me that he was totally"
alias pride7757 "say ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible.""
alias pride7758 "say "I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he account for it?""
alias pride7759 "say "It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance"
alias pride7760 "say with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more"
alias pride7761 "say advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is"
alias pride7762 "say happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though"
alias pride7763 "say we can never be what we once were to each other.""
alias pride7764 "say "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter. Good"
alias pride7765 "say girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended"
alias pride7766 "say regard.""
alias pride7767 "say "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved"
alias pride7768 "say me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming"
alias pride7769 "say down again!""
alias pride7770 "say "He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.""
alias pride7771 "say This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he"
alias pride7772 "say put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the"
alias pride7773 "say interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the"
alias pride7774 "say world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him."
alias pride7775 "say "I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane. "Oh! Lizzy,"
alias pride7776 "say why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see you as"
alias pride7777 "say happy! If there were but such another man for you!""
alias pride7778 "say "If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have"
alias pride7779 "say your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for"
alias pride7780 "say myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in"
alias pride7781 "say time.""
alias pride7782 "say The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. Mrs. Bennet"
alias pride7783 "say was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to"
alias pride7784 "say do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton. "
alias pride7785 "say The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though"
alias pride7786 "say only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to"
alias pride7787 "say be marked out for misfortune."
alias pride7788 "say Chapter 56"
alias pride7789 "say One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he"
alias pride7790 "say and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was"
alias pride7791 "say suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and"
alias pride7792 "say four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the"
alias pride7793 "say equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and"
alias pride7794 "say neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As"
alias pride7795 "say it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss"
alias pride7796 "say Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the"
alias pride7797 "say shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though"
alias pride7798 "say with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady"
alias pride7799 "say Catherine de Bourgh."
alias pride7800 "say They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond"
alias pride7801 "say their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly"
alias pride7802 "say unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt."
alias pride7803 "say She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to"
alias pride7804 "say Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a"
alias pride7805 "say word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though"
alias pride7806 "say no request of introduction had been made."
alias pride7807 "say Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance,"
alias pride7808 "say received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very"
alias pride7809 "say stiffly to Elizabeth,"
alias pride7810 "say "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother.""
alias pride7811 "say Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was."
alias pride7812 "say "And that I suppose is one of your sisters.""
alias pride7813 "say "Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine. "She is my"
alias pride7814 "say youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere"
alias pride7815 "say about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the"
alias pride7816 "say family.""
alias pride7817 "say "You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence. "
alias pride7818 "say "It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much"
alias pride7819 "say larger than Sir William Lucas's.""
alias pride7820 "say "This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows"
alias pride7821 "say are full west.""
alias pride7822 "say Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added:"
alias pride7823 "say "May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins"
alias pride7824 "say well.""
alias pride7825 "say "Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.""
alias pride7826 "say Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it"
alias pride7827 "say seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was"
alias pride7828 "say completely puzzled."
alias pride7829 "say Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady"
alias pride7830 "say Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising"
alias pride7831 "say up, said to Elizabeth,"
alias pride7832 "say "Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of"
alias pride7833 "say your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.""
alias pride7834 "say "Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and show her ladyship about the different walks. I"
alias pride7835 "say think she will be pleased with the hermitage.""
alias pride7836 "say Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble"
alias pride7837 "say guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the"
alias pride7838 "say dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent"
alias pride7839 "say looking rooms, walked on."
alias pride7840 "say Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it."
alias pride7841 "say They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was"
alias pride7842 "say determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than"
alias pride7843 "say usually insolent and disagreeable."
alias pride7844 "say "How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face."
alias pride7845 "say As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:—"
alias pride7846 "say "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your"
alias pride7847 "say own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.""
alias pride7848 "say Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment."
alias pride7849 "say "Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour"
alias pride7850 "say of seeing you here.""
alias pride7851 "say "Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not"
alias pride7852 "say to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so."
alias pride7853 "say My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such "
alias pride7854 "say moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature"
alias pride7855 "say reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most"
alias pride7856 "say advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood,"
alias pride7857 "say be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it"
alias pride7858 "say must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the"
alias pride7859 "say truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my"
alias pride7860 "say sentiments known to you.""
alias pride7861 "say "If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment"
alias pride7862 "say and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship"
alias pride7863 "say propose by it?""
alias pride7864 "say "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.""
alias pride7865 "say "Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth coolly, "will be"
alias pride7866 "say rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.""
alias pride7867 "say "If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by"
alias pride7868 "say yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?""
alias pride7869 "say "I never heard that it was.""
alias pride7870 "say "And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?""
alias pride7871 "say "I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions"
alias pride7872 "say which I shall not choose to answer.""
alias pride7873 "say "This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew,"
alias pride7874 "say made you an offer of marriage?""
alias pride7875 "say "Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.""
alias pride7876 "say "It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But your arts and"
alias pride7877 "say allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to"
alias pride7878 "say himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him in.""
alias pride7879 "say "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.""
alias pride7880 "say "Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as"
alias pride7881 "say this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his"
alias pride7882 "say dearest concerns.""
alias pride7883 "say "But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me"
alias pride7884 "say to be explicit.""
alias pride7885 "say "Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire,"
alias pride7886 "say can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you"
alias pride7887 "say to say?""
alias pride7888 "say "Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to"
alias pride7889 "say me." "
alias pride7890 "say Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:"
alias pride7891 "say "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been"
alias pride7892 "say intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of hers. While in"
alias pride7893 "say their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters"
alias pride7894 "say would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior"
alias pride7895 "say birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no"
alias pride7896 "say regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you"
alias pride7897 "say lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his"
alias pride7898 "say earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?""
alias pride7899 "say "Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to"
alias pride7900 "say my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother"
alias pride7901 "say and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in"
alias pride7902 "say planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour"
alias pride7903 "say nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am"
alias pride7904 "say that choice, why may not I accept him?""
alias pride7905 "say "Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest;"
alias pride7906 "say for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the"
alias pride7907 "say inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected"
alias pride7908 "say with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any"
alias pride7909 "say of us.""
alias pride7910 "say "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have"
alias pride7911 "say such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could,"
alias pride7912 "say upon the whole, have no cause to repine.""
alias pride7913 "say "Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions"
alias pride7914 "say to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to"
alias pride7915 "say understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my"
alias pride7916 "say purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's"
alias pride7917 "say whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.""
alias pride7918 "say "That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no"
alias pride7919 "say effect on me.""
alias pride7920 "say "I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed"
alias pride7921 "say for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on"
alias pride7922 "say the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though untitled—families. Their"
alias pride7923 "say fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every"
alias pride7924 "say member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a"
alias pride7925 "say young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must"
alias pride7926 "say not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the"
alias pride7927 "say sphere in which you have been brought up.""
alias pride7928 "say "In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a"
alias pride7929 "say gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal." "
alias pride7930 "say "True. You are a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles"
alias pride7931 "say and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.""
alias pride7932 "say "Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to"
alias pride7933 "say them, they can be nothing to you.""
alias pride7934 "say "Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?""
alias pride7935 "say Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have"
alias pride7936 "say answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation:"
alias pride7937 "say "I am not.""
alias pride7938 "say Lady Catherine seemed pleased."
alias pride7939 "say "And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?""
alias pride7940 "say "I will make no promise of the kind.""
alias pride7941 "say "Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young"
alias pride7942 "say woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away"
alias pride7943 "say till you have given me the assurance I require.""
alias pride7944 "say "And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly"
alias pride7945 "say unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving"
alias pride7946 "say you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be"
alias pride7947 "say attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his"
alias pride7948 "say cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have"
alias pride7949 "say supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged."
alias pride7950 "say You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such"
alias pride7951 "say persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his"
alias pride7952 "say affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,"
alias pride7953 "say therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.""
alias pride7954 "say "Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have"
alias pride7955 "say already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your"
alias pride7956 "say youngest sister's infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was"
alias pride7957 "say a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my"
alias pride7958 "say nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother?"
alias pride7959 "say Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus"
alias pride7960 "say polluted?""
alias pride7961 "say "You can now have nothing further to say," she resentfully answered. "You have insulted"
alias pride7962 "say me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house.""
alias pride7963 "say And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship"
alias pride7964 "say was highly incensed."
alias pride7965 "say "You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish"
alias pride7966 "say girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of"
alias pride7967 "say everybody?" "
alias pride7968 "say "Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.""
alias pride7969 "say "You are then resolved to have him?""
alias pride7970 "say "I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my"
alias pride7971 "say own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly"
alias pride7972 "say unconnected with me.""
alias pride7973 "say "It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour,"
alias pride7974 "say and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make"
alias pride7975 "say him the contempt of the world.""
alias pride7976 "say "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on"
alias pride7977 "say me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with"
alias pride7978 "say Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world,"
alias pride7979 "say if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's"
alias pride7980 "say concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.""
alias pride7981 "say "And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know"
alias pride7982 "say how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came"
alias pride7983 "say to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.""
alias pride7984 "say In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when,"
alias pride7985 "say turning hastily round, she added, "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no"
alias pride7986 "say compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously"
alias pride7987 "say displeased.""
alias pride7988 "say Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into"
alias pride7989 "say the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded"
alias pride7990 "say up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady"
alias pride7991 "say Catherine would not come in again and rest herself."
alias pride7992 "say "She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go.""
alias pride7993 "say "She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she"
alias pride7994 "say only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I"
alias pride7995 "say dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose"
alias pride7996 "say she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?""
alias pride7997 "say Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance"
alias pride7998 "say of their conversation was impossible."
alias pride7999 "say Chapter 57"
alias pride8000 "say The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not"
alias pride8001 "say be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. "
alias pride8002 "say Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for"
alias pride8003 "say the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational"
alias pride8004 "say scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth"
alias pride8005 "say was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley,"
alias pride8006 "say and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding"
alias pride8007 "say made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel"
alias pride8008 "say that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her"
alias pride8009 "say neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses,"
alias pride8010 "say the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost"
alias pride8011 "say certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time."
alias pride8012 "say In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some"
alias pride8013 "say uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what"
alias pride8014 "say she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she"
alias pride8015 "say must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation"
alias pride8016 "say of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the"
alias pride8017 "say exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was"
alias pride8018 "say natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was"
alias pride8019 "say certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose immediate"
alias pride8020 "say connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side."
alias pride8021 "say With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth"
alias pride8022 "say had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning."
alias pride8023 "say If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely,"
alias pride8024 "say the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at"
alias pride8025 "say once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return"
alias pride8026 "say no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to"
alias pride8027 "say Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way."
alias pride8028 "say "If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a"
alias pride8029 "say few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every"
alias pride8030 "say expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he"
alias pride8031 "say might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.""
alias pride8032 "say The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very"
alias pride8033 "say great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased"
alias pride8034 "say Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject."
alias pride8035 "say The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father, who came out"
alias pride8036 "say of his library with a letter in his hand."
alias pride8037 "say "Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room.""
alias pride8038 "say She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was"
alias pride8039 "say heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held."
alias pride8040 "say It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with"
alias pride8041 "say dismay all the consequent explanations. "
alias pride8042 "say She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then said,"
alias pride8043 "say "I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it"
alias pride8044 "say principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I"
alias pride8045 "say had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important"
alias pride8046 "say conquest.""
alias pride8047 "say The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its"
alias pride8048 "say being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most"
alias pride8049 "say to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather"
alias pride8050 "say addressed to herself; when her father continued:"
alias pride8051 "say "You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I"
alias pride8052 "say think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is"
alias pride8053 "say from Mr. Collins.""
alias pride8054 "say "From Mr. Collins! and what can he have to say?""
alias pride8055 "say "Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with congratulations on the"
alias pride8056 "say approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of"
alias pride8057 "say the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading"
alias pride8058 "say what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus offered you"
alias pride8059 "say the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add"
alias pride8060 "say a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same"
alias pride8061 "say authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet,"
alias pride8062 "say after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably"
alias pride8063 "say looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.'"
alias pride8064 "say "Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" 'This young gentleman is blessed,"
alias pride8065 "say in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property,"
alias pride8066 "say noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn"
alias pride8067 "say my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with"
alias pride8068 "say this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate"
alias pride8069 "say advantage of.'"
alias pride8070 "say "Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:"
alias pride8071 "say "'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt,"
alias pride8072 "say Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.'"
alias pride8073 "say "Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or"
alias pride8074 "say the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name"
alias pride8075 "say would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks"
alias pride8076 "say at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is"
alias pride8077 "say admirable!""
alias pride8078 "say Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant"
alias pride8079 "say smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her."
alias pride8080 "say "Are you not diverted?" "
alias pride8081 "say "Oh! yes. Pray read on.""
alias pride8082 "say "'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she"
alias pride8083 "say immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when"
alias pride8084 "say it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin,"
alias pride8085 "say she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my"
alias pride8086 "say duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer"
alias pride8087 "say may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been"
alias pride8088 "say properly sanctioned.' Mr. Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's"
alias pride8089 "say sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together"
alias pride8090 "say before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect"
alias pride8091 "say the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you"
alias pride8092 "say received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an"
alias pride8093 "say encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously"
alias pride8094 "say have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit"
alias pride8095 "say them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion"
alias pride8096 "say of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation,"
alias pride8097 "say and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it."
alias pride8098 "say You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For"
alias pride8099 "say what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?""
alias pride8100 "say "Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!""
alias pride8101 "say "Yes—that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have"
alias pride8102 "say been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully"
alias pride8103 "say absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for"
alias pride8104 "say any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference"
alias pride8105 "say even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And"
alias pride8106 "say pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her"
alias pride8107 "say consent?""
alias pride8108 "say To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without"
alias pride8109 "say the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been"
alias pride8110 "say more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh,"
alias pride8111 "say when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he"
alias pride8112 "say said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of"
alias pride8113 "say penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too"
alias pride8114 "say much."
alias pride8115 "say Chapter 58"
alias pride8116 "say Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected"
alias pride8117 "say Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days"
alias pride8118 "say had passed after Lady Catherine's visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. "
alias pride8119 "say Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in"
alias pride8120 "say momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking"
alias pride8121 "say out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare"
alias pride8122 "say time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the"
alias pride8123 "say others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to"
alias pride8124 "say entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk;"
alias pride8125 "say Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the"
alias pride8126 "say same."
alias pride8127 "say They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as"
alias pride8128 "say Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went"
alias pride8129 "say boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and,"
alias pride8130 "say while her courage was high, she immediately said:"
alias pride8131 "say "Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own"
alias pride8132 "say feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you"
alias pride8133 "say for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been"
alias pride8134 "say most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of"
alias pride8135 "say my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.""
alias pride8136 "say "I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that"
alias pride8137 "say you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I"
alias pride8138 "say did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.""
alias pride8139 "say "You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had"
alias pride8140 "say been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let"
alias pride8141 "say me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion"
alias pride8142 "say which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of"
alias pride8143 "say discovering them.""
alias pride8144 "say "If you will thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving"
alias pride8145 "say happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not"
alias pride8146 "say attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I"
alias pride8147 "say thought only of you.""
alias pride8148 "say Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion"
alias pride8149 "say added, "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last"
alias pride8150 "say April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you"
alias pride8151 "say will silence me on this subject for ever.""
alias pride8152 "say Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation,"
alias pride8153 "say now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to"
alias pride8154 "say understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to"
alias pride8155 "say which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances."
alias pride8156 "say The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before;"
alias pride8157 "say and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in"
alias pride8158 "say love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have"
alias pride8159 "say seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, "
alias pride8160 "say though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of"
alias pride8161 "say what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable."
alias pride8162 "say They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought,"
alias pride8163 "say and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted"
alias pride8164 "say for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her"
alias pride8165 "say return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the"
alias pride8166 "say substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of"
alias pride8167 "say the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and"
alias pride8168 "say assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise"
alias pride8169 "say from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect"
alias pride8170 "say had been exactly contrariwise."
alias pride8171 "say "It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I"
alias pride8172 "say knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably"
alias pride8173 "say decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and"
alias pride8174 "say openly.""
alias pride8175 "say Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my frankness"
alias pride8176 "say to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have"
alias pride8177 "say no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.""
alias pride8178 "say "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were illfounded,"
alias pride8179 "say formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the"
alias pride8180 "say severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.""
alias pride8181 "say "We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said"
alias pride8182 "say Elizabeth. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since"
alias pride8183 "say then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.""
alias pride8184 "say "I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my"
alias pride8185 "say conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many"
alias pride8186 "say months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had"
alias pride8187 "say you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you"
alias pride8188 "say can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I confess,"
alias pride8189 "say before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.""
alias pride8190 "say "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not"
alias pride8191 "say the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.""
alias pride8192 "say "I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure"
alias pride8193 "say you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have"
alias pride8194 "say addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.""
alias pride8195 "say "Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you"
alias pride8196 "say that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.""
alias pride8197 "say Darcy mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it soon make you think better of me?"
alias pride8198 "say Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?" "
alias pride8199 "say She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former"
alias pride8200 "say prejudices had been removed."
alias pride8201 "say "I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you"
alias pride8202 "say have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should"
alias pride8203 "say dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which"
alias pride8204 "say might justly make you hate me.""
alias pride8205 "say "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my"
alias pride8206 "say regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they"
alias pride8207 "say are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.""
alias pride8208 "say "When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but"
alias pride8209 "say I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.""
alias pride8210 "say "The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself."
alias pride8211 "say But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who"
alias pride8212 "say received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant"
alias pride8213 "say circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy."
alias pride8214 "say Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.""
alias pride8215 "say "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so"
alias pride8216 "say totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but,"
alias pride8217 "say what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will"
alias pride8218 "say intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my"
alias pride8219 "say life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was"
alias pride8220 "say not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in"
alias pride8221 "say pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by"
alias pride8222 "say my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent"
alias pride8223 "say and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care"
alias pride8224 "say for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish"
alias pride8225 "say at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from"
alias pride8226 "say eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest"
alias pride8227 "say Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most"
alias pride8228 "say advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my"
alias pride8229 "say reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman"
alias pride8230 "say worthy of being pleased.""
alias pride8231 "say "Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?""
alias pride8232 "say "Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting"
alias pride8233 "say my addresses.""
alias pride8234 "say "My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant"
alias pride8235 "say to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me"
alias pride8236 "say after that evening?""
alias pride8237 "say "Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper"
alias pride8238 "say direction." "
alias pride8239 "say "I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You"
alias pride8240 "say blamed me for coming?""
alias pride8241 "say "No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.""
alias pride8242 "say "Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience"
alias pride8243 "say told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to"
alias pride8244 "say receive more than my due.""
alias pride8245 "say "My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I"
alias pride8246 "say was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your"
alias pride8247 "say ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other"
alias pride8248 "say wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had"
alias pride8249 "say seen you.""
alias pride8250 "say He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at"
alias pride8251 "say its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon"
alias pride8252 "say learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been"
alias pride8253 "say formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen"
alias pride8254 "say from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend."
alias pride8255 "say She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on"
alias pride8256 "say farther."
alias pride8257 "say After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about"
alias pride8258 "say it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home."
alias pride8259 "say "What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the"
alias pride8260 "say discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given"
alias pride8261 "say him the earliest information of it."
alias pride8262 "say "I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth."
alias pride8263 "say "Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.""
alias pride8264 "say "That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much." And though he"
alias pride8265 "say exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case."
alias pride8266 "say "On the evening before my going to London," said he, "I made a confession to him,"
alias pride8267 "say which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make"
alias pride8268 "say my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had"
alias pride8269 "say never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in"
alias pride8270 "say supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily"
alias pride8271 "say perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness"
alias pride8272 "say together.""
alias pride8273 "say Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend."
alias pride8274 "say "Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister"
alias pride8275 "say loved him, or merely from my information last spring?" "
alias pride8276 "say "From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately"
alias pride8277 "say made here; and I was convinced of her affection.""
alias pride8278 "say "And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.""
alias pride8279 "say "It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending"
alias pride8280 "say on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I"
alias pride8281 "say was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could"
alias pride8282 "say not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I"
alias pride8283 "say had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded,"
alias pride8284 "say lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily"
alias pride8285 "say forgiven me now.""
alias pride8286 "say Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily"
alias pride8287 "say guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had"
alias pride8288 "say yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the"
alias pride8289 "say happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the"
alias pride8290 "say conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted."
alias pride8291 "say Chapter 59"
alias pride8292 "say "My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth"
alias pride8293 "say received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat"
alias pride8294 "say down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was"
alias pride8295 "say beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else,"
alias pride8296 "say awakened a suspicion of the truth."
alias pride8297 "say The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged"
alias pride8298 "say lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition"
alias pride8299 "say in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew"
alias pride8300 "say that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,"
alias pride8301 "say there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her"
alias pride8302 "say situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that"
alias pride8303 "say with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away."
alias pride8304 "say At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's"
alias pride8305 "say general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here."
alias pride8306 "say "You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not"
alias pride8307 "say deceive me. I know it to be impossible.""
alias pride8308 "say "This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure"
alias pride8309 "say nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but"
alias pride8310 "say the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged." "
alias pride8311 "say Jane looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike"
alias pride8312 "say him.""
alias pride8313 "say "You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love"
alias pride8314 "say him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is"
alias pride8315 "say the last time I shall ever remember it myself.""
alias pride8316 "say Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her"
alias pride8317 "say of its truth."
alias pride8318 "say "Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane. "My dear,"
alias pride8319 "say dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are"
alias pride8320 "say you quite certain that you can be happy with him?""
alias pride8321 "say "There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the"
alias pride8322 "say happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a"
alias pride8323 "say brother?""
alias pride8324 "say "Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we"
alias pride8325 "say considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough?"
alias pride8326 "say Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel"
alias pride8327 "say what you ought to do?""
alias pride8328 "say "Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all.""
alias pride8329 "say "What do you mean?""
alias pride8330 "say "Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be"
alias pride8331 "say angry.""
alias pride8332 "say "My dearest sister, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every"
alias pride8333 "say thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?""
alias pride8334 "say "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I"
alias pride8335 "say must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.""
alias pride8336 "say Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she"
alias pride8337 "say soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article,"
alias pride8338 "say Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish."
alias pride8339 "say "Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a"
alias pride8340 "say value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him;"
alias pride8341 "say but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more"
alias pride8342 "say dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you"
alias pride8343 "say tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not"
alias pride8344 "say to you.""
alias pride8345 "say Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention"
alias pride8346 "say Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of"
alias pride8347 "say his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All"
alias pride8348 "say was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation. "
alias pride8349 "say "Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that"
alias pride8350 "say disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean"
alias pride8351 "say by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go ashooting,"
alias pride8352 "say or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do"
alias pride8353 "say with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way.""
alias pride8354 "say Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed"
alias pride8355 "say that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet."
alias pride8356 "say As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with"
alias pride8357 "say such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud,"
alias pride8358 "say "Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again"
alias pride8359 "say to-day?""
alias pride8360 "say "I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount"
alias pride8361 "say this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.""
alias pride8362 "say "It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too"
alias pride8363 "say much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?" Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy"
alias pride8364 "say professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently"
alias pride8365 "say consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:"
alias pride8366 "say "I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to"
alias pride8367 "say yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no"
alias pride8368 "say occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to"
alias pride8369 "say inconvenience.""
alias pride8370 "say During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the"
alias pride8371 "say course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's. She"
alias pride8372 "say could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his"
alias pride8373 "say wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether"
alias pride8374 "say she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that"
alias pride8375 "say her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more"
alias pride8376 "say bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her"
alias pride8377 "say disapprobation."
alias pride8378 "say In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise"
alias pride8379 "say also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father's"
alias pride8380 "say opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her"
alias pride8381 "say means—that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be"
alias pride8382 "say filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection, and she"
alias pride8383 "say sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved"
alias pride8384 "say by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty;"
alias pride8385 "say and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants"
alias pride8386 "say you in the library." She was gone directly. "
alias pride8387 "say Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. "Lizzy," said he,"
alias pride8388 "say "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you"
alias pride8389 "say always hated him?""
alias pride8390 "say How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her"
alias pride8391 "say expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions"
alias pride8392 "say which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured"
alias pride8393 "say him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy."
alias pride8394 "say "Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may"
alias pride8395 "say have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?""
alias pride8396 "say "Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?""
alias pride8397 "say "None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be"
alias pride8398 "say nothing if you really liked him.""
alias pride8399 "say "I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him. Indeed he has no"
alias pride8400 "say improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do"
alias pride8401 "say not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.""
alias pride8402 "say "Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to"
alias pride8403 "say whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to"
alias pride8404 "say you, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know"
alias pride8405 "say your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you"
alias pride8406 "say truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents"
alias pride8407 "say would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape"
alias pride8408 "say discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect"
alias pride8409 "say your partner in life. You know not what you are about.""
alias pride8410 "say Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by"
alias pride8411 "say repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the"
alias pride8412 "say gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty"
alias pride8413 "say that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months'"
alias pride8414 "say suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's"
alias pride8415 "say incredulity, and reconcile him to the match."
alias pride8416 "say "Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say. If this be the"
alias pride8417 "say case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.""
alias pride8418 "say To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had"
alias pride8419 "say voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment."
alias pride8420 "say "This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the"
alias pride8421 "say match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the"
alias pride8422 "say better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I"
alias pride8423 "say must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own"
alias pride8424 "say way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and"
alias pride8425 "say there will be an end of the matter." "
alias pride8426 "say He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's"
alias pride8427 "say letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted"
alias pride8428 "say the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at"
alias pride8429 "say leisure.""
alias pride8430 "say Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's"
alias pride8431 "say quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure."
alias pride8432 "say Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no"
alias pride8433 "say longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come"
alias pride8434 "say in time."
alias pride8435 "say When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the"
alias pride8436 "say important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs."
alias pride8437 "say Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes"
alias pride8438 "say that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what"
alias pride8439 "say was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She"
alias pride8440 "say began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and"
alias pride8441 "say bless herself."
alias pride8442 "say "Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have"
alias pride8443 "say thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will"
alias pride8444 "say be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it—"
alias pride8445 "say nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming man!—so handsome! so tall!—"
alias pride8446 "say Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he"
alias pride8447 "say will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three"
alias pride8448 "say daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go"
alias pride8449 "say distracted.""
alias pride8450 "say This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth,"
alias pride8451 "say rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she"
alias pride8452 "say had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her."
alias pride8453 "say "My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very"
alias pride8454 "say likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married"
alias pride8455 "say by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond"
alias pride8456 "say of, that I may have it to-morrow.""
alias pride8457 "say This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be;"
alias pride8458 "say and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and"
alias pride8459 "say secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow"
alias pride8460 "say passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her"
alias pride8461 "say intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to"
alias pride8462 "say offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion."
alias pride8463 "say Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with"
alias pride8464 "say him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem."
alias pride8465 "say "I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. "Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite;"
alias pride8466 "say but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's." "
alias pride8467 "say Chapter 60"
alias pride8468 "say Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for"
alias pride8469 "say his having ever fallen in love with her. "How could you begin?" said she. "I can"
alias pride8470 "say comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what"
alias pride8471 "say could set you off in the first place?""
alias pride8472 "say "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation."
alias pride8473 "say It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.""
alias pride8474 "say "My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my behaviour to you was"
alias pride8475 "say at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to"
alias pride8476 "say give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?""
alias pride8477 "say "For the liveliness of your mind, I did.""
alias pride8478 "say "You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you"
alias pride8479 "say were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the"
alias pride8480 "say women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I"
alias pride8481 "say roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them. Had you not been really amiable,"
alias pride8482 "say you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your"
alias pride8483 "say feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons"
alias pride8484 "say who so assiduously courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;"
alias pride8485 "say and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you"
alias pride8486 "say knew no actual good of me—but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love.""
alias pride8487 "say "Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at"
alias pride8488 "say Netherfield?""
alias pride8489 "say "Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means."
alias pride8490 "say My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as"
alias pride8491 "say possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with"
alias pride8492 "say you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so"
alias pride8493 "say unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called,"
alias pride8494 "say and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not"
alias pride8495 "say care about me?""
alias pride8496 "say "Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.""
alias pride8497 "say "But I was embarrassed.""
alias pride8498 "say "And so was I.""
alias pride8499 "say "You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.""
alias pride8500 "say "A man who had felt less, might." "
alias pride8501 "say "How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so"
alias pride8502 "say reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been"
alias pride8503 "say left to yourself. I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you! My"
alias pride8504 "say resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. Too much, I"
alias pride8505 "say am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise?"
alias pride8506 "say for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do.""
alias pride8507 "say "You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine's"
alias pride8508 "say unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not"
alias pride8509 "say indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was"
alias pride8510 "say not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt's intelligence had given me hope,"
alias pride8511 "say and I was determined at once to know every thing.""
alias pride8512 "say "Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to"
alias pride8513 "say be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to"
alias pride8514 "say Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?""
alias pride8515 "say "My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to"
alias pride8516 "say make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your"
alias pride8517 "say sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I"
alias pride8518 "say have since made.""
alias pride8519 "say "Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her?""
alias pride8520 "say "I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to be done, and"
alias pride8521 "say if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.""
alias pride8522 "say "And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of"
alias pride8523 "say your writing, as another young lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be"
alias pride8524 "say longer neglected.""
alias pride8525 "say From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated,"
alias pride8526 "say Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having that to"
alias pride8527 "say communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find"
alias pride8528 "say that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as"
alias pride8529 "say follows:"
alias pride8530 "say "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long,"
alias pride8531 "say kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You"
alias pride8532 "say supposed more than really existed. But now suppose as much as you choose; give a loose"
alias pride8533 "say rein to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will"
alias pride8534 "say afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write"
alias pride8535 "say again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you,"
alias pride8536 "say again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea"
alias pride8537 "say of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature"
alias pride8538 "say in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am"
alias pride8539 "say happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the"
alias pride8540 "say world that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours,"
alias pride8541 "say etc." "
alias pride8542 "say Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from"
alias pride8543 "say either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last."
alias pride8544 "say "DEAR SIR,"
alias pride8545 "say "I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr."
alias pride8546 "say Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the"
alias pride8547 "say nephew. He has more to give."
alias pride8548 "say "Yours sincerely, etc.""
alias pride8549 "say Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that"
alias pride8550 "say was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her"
alias pride8551 "say delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was"
alias pride8552 "say affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder"
alias pride8553 "say answer than she knew was deserved."
alias pride8554 "say The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as"
alias pride8555 "say her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight,"
alias pride8556 "say and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister."
alias pride8557 "say Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth"
alias pride8558 "say from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to"
alias pride8559 "say Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had"
alias pride8560 "say been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte,"
alias pride8561 "say really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At"
alias pride8562 "say such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the"
alias pride8563 "say course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she"
alias pride8564 "say saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore"
alias pride8565 "say it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he"
alias pride8566 "say complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his"
alias pride8567 "say hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did"
alias pride8568 "say shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight."
alias pride8569 "say Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and"
alias pride8570 "say though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the"
alias pride8571 "say familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she"
alias pride8572 "say must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to"
alias pride8573 "say make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of"
alias pride8574 "say either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom"
alias pride8575 "say he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising"
alias pride8576 "say from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of"
alias pride8577 "say the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed"
alias pride8578 "say from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party"
alias pride8579 "say at Pemberley. "
alias pride8580 "say Chapter 61"
alias pride8581 "say Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two"
alias pride8582 "say most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley,"
alias pride8583 "say and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family,"
alias pride8584 "say that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her"
alias pride8585 "say children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed"
alias pride8586 "say woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not"
alias pride8587 "say have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous"
alias pride8588 "say and invariably silly."
alias pride8589 "say Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him"
alias pride8590 "say oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley,"
alias pride8591 "say especially when he was least expected."
alias pride8592 "say Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to"
alias pride8593 "say her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her"
alias pride8594 "say affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a"
alias pride8595 "say neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other"
alias pride8596 "say source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other."
alias pride8597 "say Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder"
alias pride8598 "say sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great."
alias pride8599 "say She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of"
alias pride8600 "say Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less"
alias pride8601 "say ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of"
alias pride8602 "say course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay"
alias pride8603 "say with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her"
alias pride8604 "say going."
alias pride8605 "say Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from"
alias pride8606 "say the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was"
alias pride8607 "say obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit;"
alias pride8608 "say and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,"
alias pride8609 "say it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance."
alias pride8610 "say As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of"
alias pride8611 "say her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become"
alias pride8612 "say acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her;"
alias pride8613 "say and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed"
alias pride8614 "say on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on"
alias pride8615 "say her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was"
alias pride8616 "say cherished. The letter was to this effect:"
alias pride8617 "say "MY DEAR LIZZY,"
alias pride8618 "say "I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must"
alias pride8619 "say be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to "
alias pride8620 "say do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much,"
alias pride8621 "say and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any"
alias pride8622 "say place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr."
alias pride8623 "say Darcy about it, if you had rather not."
alias pride8624 "say "Yours, etc.""
alias pride8625 "say As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put"
alias pride8626 "say an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her"
alias pride8627 "say power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private"
alias pride8628 "say expences, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income"
alias pride8629 "say as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of"
alias pride8630 "say the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their"
alias pride8631 "say quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance"
alias pride8632 "say towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace"
alias pride8633 "say dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from"
alias pride8634 "say place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His"
alias pride8635 "say affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her"
alias pride8636 "say youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had"
alias pride8637 "say given her."
alias pride8638 "say Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted"
alias pride8639 "say him further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was"
alias pride8640 "say gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them"
alias pride8641 "say frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded"
alias pride8642 "say so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone."
alias pride8643 "say Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it"
alias pride8644 "say advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was"
alias pride8645 "say fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every"
alias pride8646 "say arrear of civility to Elizabeth."
alias pride8647 "say Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly"
alias pride8648 "say what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they"
alias pride8649 "say intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she"
alias pride8650 "say often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of"
alias pride8651 "say talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost"
alias pride8652 "say overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received"
alias pride8653 "say knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began"
alias pride8654 "say to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not"
alias pride8655 "say always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself."
alias pride8656 "say Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave"
alias pride8657 "say way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced"
alias pride8658 "say its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for"
alias pride8659 "say some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was"
alias pride8660 "say prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further"
alias pride8661 "say resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him,"
alias pride8662 "say or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on "
alias pride8663 "say them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from"
alias pride8664 "say the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city."
alias pride8665 "say With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as"
alias pride8666 "say Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude"
alias pride8667 "say towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting"
alias pride8668 "say them."
