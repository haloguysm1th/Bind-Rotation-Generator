alias prettygood6 "say of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become"
alias prettygood7 "say aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met"
alias prettygood8 "say lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it."

alias prettygood14 "say question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new"
alias prettygood15 "say to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is."
alias prettygood16 "say Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I"
alias prettygood17 "say don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm"
alias prettygood18 "say writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published."
alias prettygood19 "say And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of"
alias prettygood20 "say it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent."
alias prettygood21 "say I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The"
alias prettygood22 "say following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to"
alias prettygood23 "say capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and"
alias prettygood24 "say knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think"
alias prettygood25 "say that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while"
alias prettygood26 "say your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the"
alias prettygood27 "say sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I"
alias prettygood28 "say don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I"
alias prettygood29 "say don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other"
alias prettygood30 "say acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize"
alias prettygood31 "say the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music"
alias prettygood32 "say they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great"
alias prettygood33 "say many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst"
alias prettygood34 "say enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for"
alias prettygood35 "say him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken"
alias prettygood36 "say a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll"
alias prettygood37 "say fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the"
alias prettygood38 "say other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting"
alias prettygood39 "say them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious,"
alias prettygood40 "say because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If"
alias prettygood41 "say I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life."
alias prettygood42 "say Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me"
alias prettygood43 "say and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't"
alias prettygood44 "say believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening"
alias prettygood45 "say unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of"
alias prettygood46 "say relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never"
alias prettygood47 "say participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different"
alias prettygood48 "say personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of"
alias prettygood49 "say anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I"
alias prettygood50 "say look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting"
alias prettygood51 "say like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of"
alias prettygood52 "say tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In"
alias prettygood53 "say closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I"
alias prettygood54 "say spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the"
alias prettygood55 "say community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there."
alias prettygood56 "say Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote"
alias prettygood57 "say was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post,"
alias prettygood58 "say only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator."
